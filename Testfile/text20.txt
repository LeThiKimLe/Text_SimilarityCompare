The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times. However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.
• Malaysia's model of enforcement agency (Pemandu)
Background: In 2009, the Malaysian government faced a series of dilemmas similar to many other developing countries, such as the middle-income trap, budget deficit ratio, and public debt ratio. is very large, the crime and corruption rate is high, the labor productivity is stagnant, the bureaucracy of the public administration is clearly revealed, from which people gradually lose confidence in the management process of the Government. government, losing faith in the promise that by 2020, Malaysia will become a high-income country. Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times.

Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.

However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report.

One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.

These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.
• Malaysia's model of enforcement agency (Pemandu)
Background: In 2009, the Malaysian government faced a series of dilemmas similar to many other developing countries, such as the middle-income trap, budget deficit ratio, and public debt ratio. is very large, the crime and corruption rate is high, the labor productivity is stagnant, the bureaucracy of the public administration is clearly revealed, from which people gradually lose confidence in the management process of the Government. government, losing faith in the promise that by 2020, Malaysia will become a high-income country. Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.

Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.

The truth is the key to properly preparing and protecting yourself and others
Dear. However, the sad reality is that nowadays fake news is rampant. In the context of
Health crisis, misinformation can make people's prevention ineffective
and vulnerable to epidemics, while spreading fear and stigma.
During the time when the Covid-19 epidemic was raging, Vietnamese students had to deal with
face many difficulties and challenges.
About learning: The quality of online teaching is one of the things students do
most interested. Some of the difficulties of taking an online class are the quality of the road
unstable transmission, malfunction of audio-visual equipment on the computer; problems interacting with
faculty and class members; and mentally tired, "saturated" when studying in front of the screen
electronic devices for too long for many days. This affects both health and
students' ability to acquire knowledge, while also affecting mental health when not

Faced with the complicated and stressful situation of the epidemic, many universities and colleges
Colleges as well as research centers have temporarily stopped sending students to school

This also makes many students feel sad and lonely.
According to the latest survey of the People's Public Security (ANTV) newspaper on August 7, 2021, there are
nearly 90% of Vietnamese people surveyed said that income was greatly and negatively affected,
about 41% of household income decreased by more than 20% because of the epidemic.
After more than 1 year, the outbreak of covid 19 has left an impact on society and the economy
reality is enormous. The lives of many households are turned upside down, production and business
stopped, many workers fell into unemployment
The Covid-19 pandemic has taken place since the end of 2019 and has had a comprehensive impact on,
spreading to all countries in the world, is still complicated development. Presently
At present, the risk of rapid spread of the disease is still very great. Many impacts are forecasted
prolonged and many changes in social life even after the epidemic is over. Whether it's a country
is highly appreciated for its effectiveness in fighting the epidemic, but Vietnam's economy will not avoid it
from adverse impacts, business lines and fields were strongly reduced,
greatly affect the health of businesses and people's lives. Especially for
people, low- and middle-income families, the effects are evident
sharpest.
From those reasons, students are greatly affected in terms of tuition fees as well as
learning conditions in a negative direction.

Dog worship is quite common in many ethnic groups around the world, and is present in almost every country
myths of the peoples of mainland Southeast Asia. The domestic dog is worshiped in a
Some places in Vietnam as guardian animals (gods of the gate), want to guard the part
Yin must raise a dog. This worshiping custom is quite common in rural villages and communes of
In Vietnam, many locals still keep the custom of burying stone dogs in front of the door, or
Put the stone dog on the altar or put the stone dog in front of the gate of the house or temple to ward off evil spirits.
Indoor stone dogs are usually small, gentle in appearance, not as big as stone dogs
in communal houses, temples, and palaces. Stone dog worship is quite popular in the countryside and surrounding areas
Hanoi like Dan Phuong, Ha Tay (old), Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Hung Yen, Lang
Son has many places that also have the custom of worshiping stone dogs such as Chi Lang, Dong Mo, Khon Leng,
That Khe, Trang Dinh, Dong Dang, Cao Loc.
In the communal house of Nhan My village, My Dinh ward, Nam Tu Liem district, Hanoi, there are
The corpse of a buzzard (earth eagle) was embalmed by the villagers in a glass cabinet and honored
Worshiped like a god, this eagle is loved by the villagers

Burning incense and worshiping here because it is not possible to line up with the four scenes of the city
This worship originated when the people of Nhan My village in Hanoi saw
a buzzard from unknown place came to the tree in the middle of the village field,
before the tree was cut down, the local people saw the buzzard wailing day and night,
One day, when the buzzard came home from looking for food, and saw that the nest was cut down, he rushed into the wall
dead wall. People give Yes, it's a sacred bird, so I made a vow to mummify it,
tanned leather and put it in a glass cabinet for everyone to remember. The story of a suicide eagle
Maybe it's because the villagers anthropomorphize because of their love for birds, or rumors about birds?
Land eagles have the ability to predict the weather, sunshine and rain only through calls.
The snake is an animal that is worshiped and worshiped all over the world. Export
Originating from the fear of snakes, people deify snakes as water gods and worship them
make offerings to snakes so that they won't harm you and protect you. In Vietnam, snakes

Phai Lua Festival is a traditional festival in Bac Giang river area, commune
Hong Phong, Binh Gia district, Lang Son province. Festivals associated with legends
related to the custom of worshiping Snake God and River God. The legendary Serpent God is a child
Raised by grandparents, fishermen, helped people to kill bamboo boats in the river for a living
peaceful. The villagers were grateful, so they set up a communal house to worship their father, God Snake, and Ba communal house to worship their mother
Snake God and set up a small shrine to worship Snake God. To remember God's grace, every 3
Once a year (leap year), on the 4th day of the fourth lunar month, when the Snake god comes to visit
Parents and villagers solemnly held the Phai Lua festival.
Ceremony part:
Lion team (12 - 16 people) with the following components: the lion leader
squishy); drummer (cam choong); gong player or stick la (cam la);
the person holding the cymbal (the cymbal); orangutan face performer (leopard - heartbroken)
winter alarm); the monkey face performer (dismayed) and the members dance with bare hands,
trident dance, short knife, stick dance, table dance...
Special offerings include sticky rice wine (sacred mouth tincture), wormwood cake
(Peng Xiai), gathered at Ong communal house and on the banks of Van Mich river before the time
festival takes place.
Offerings are arranged in front of the altar according to regulations, including village offerings,
In the village, Pu Mo stood in front of the altar, adjusted his clothes and made sacrifices to the Snake God,
invite God to attend the festival, visit his adoptive parents and villagers; in the sense of opening up rivers,
Praying for the Serpent God to bless everyone with good health, peace, and crops
bountiful, all things multiply, boats are full of shrimp and fish...
Next is the procession of the Snake God procession. A young man representing the villagers
Go up to burn incense, worship at communal house, altar to Snake God, then process incense bowl to worship
God put in palanquin. The procession is led by the lions, followed by the flag procession
Assembly, a palanquin of the Snake God, representing the three families of Vy, Do, Nong, and finally the people

in the commune and the tourists attending the festival. The procession departs from Ong communal house to
Tho Cong temple, Van Mich street to present and ask for permission of Tho Cong. After that, the group
Go around the market and Van Mich street counterclockwise. Every family on
The route the procession passes and the Van Mich market both make a vegetarian meal
to welcome the Snake God, may God bless, bless, and bless you to be strong
healthy, safe. When passing through families, the lion team all perform a ritual to greet God
Farming in front of the ceremony tray with dance movements when raising your head, bowing low, bowing to the tray
holiday with the desire to pray for fortune, happiness, luck, business and daily life
more and more prosperous to everyone, every home. When the group reached the riverbank, the Serpent God palanquin
and the altar was lowered, placed in the tabernacle (symbolic temple) prepared in advance,
in the direction facing the Pac Lo Dang river - where Than's younger brother was caught by the stream
years ago and also the place where the Snake God came from. Here people prepare a tray
The dish includes: pork, sticky rice, chicken, wine and traditional confectionery of the nation. Pu
Mo continues to do the ceremony for the second time, praying to the Serpent God to help organize fun games
health on the day of welcoming and inviting God to celebrate with the people.
Assembly part:
After the ritual of sacrifice and procession of the Serpent God, the competition part of the boys
boys represent villages and hamlets in the commune. Before the competition, representatives of the teams gathered
Burn incense in front of the Snake God altar before participating in some traditional sports
such as: rowing contest (Phi Lua), swimming (cloth and),scuba diving competition, foot-catching diving competition
ducks (mon pair kha pat), lion dance (sub-loong), sli singing and games and performances
other time.
Thu Le village festival, here, Linh Lang Dai Vuong was originally a god snake, he was
All of the seven brothers of the snake god, after making merit to help the country, he turned into a Giao dragon
down to West Lake.
Type of animal worshiped: snake
Place of worship:
16
Because of his glorious merits, he was allowed to worship 269 villages throughout the country to build temples
shrine and ordained Linh Lang Dai Vuong Thuong Dang Phuc Than. Linh Lang
The Great King is worshiped in many places, but the most famous is in Thu Le Area, Van
Phuc, Ba Dinh, Hanoi and the temples of Bao Ha, Bao Ha, Dong Minh, Vinh Bao and in the villages
Kenh Trach, Thuong village of Ke Son village (Ke Son canton), Dich Luong village, Luong
Trach in Ha Am canton, Vinh Bao.
Voi Phuc Temple is the main place of worship.
Typical places of celebration:
The 10th day of February (lunar calendar) every year is the transformation day of Linh Lang Dai Vuong - a god
venerable god. Noi An Village (Dai Yen, Chuong My, Hanoi) is one of 269 places
(the country's farm village) worships the village's Thanh Hoang god.
Cultural spiritual meaning:
According to divine genealogy, associated with Vietnamese history of the Ly dynasty: Linh Lang was the fourth son of the king
Ly Thanh Tong, born on December 13, 1064, in Tri market (present-day Thu Le),
Her name is Hoang Chan, her mother is the 9th concubine of King Ly Thanh Tong, she is from Dan Phuong
(Old Ha Tay). Prince Hoang Chan participated in defeating the invading Song army. After
After defeating the Song invaders, Prince Hoang Chan contracted smallpox, before he died, please the king
Toss the iron flag, which way the flag flies, enjoy from that place… Then Hoang Lang turned
turned into a white snake diving into West Lake. The king mourned for the construction of a temple in his motherland
Suddenly Lai, in Thi Trai and gave 269 other places, wherever Hoang Lang's flag flew and
If there is manifestation, then worship. Phong Than is Linh Lang Dai Vuong.
Manifestations:
- First, the long communal house procession team asks permission to process two bowls of incense.
- Bring two bowls of incense out of the harem.
- Then bring Thanh Hoang - Linh Lang Dai Vuong out of the harem. Who's in the back?
The bow must also cover the mouth.
- Dance and sing to ask for permission to carry Thanh Hoang from Dinh to Quan Dinh.
- Then settle for Thanh Hoang.
- Next, the procession of the dragon family and the flying palanquin
- Finally, fun activities with folk games.
The belief in animal worship in our country is one of the beauties of nature
The humanities of the Vietnamese are present everywhere in Vietnam, and the people
Every province also maintains that belief as a spiritual product of historical value
unique cultural history, associated with the vitality and development of a land, combined with
from the process of settlement and community. At the same time, express gratitude and adoration
of the community in front of nature since the early days of land opening.
Life in the mountains and forests every day is faced with animals,
Most ethnic groups often believe that wild animals such as tigers, leopards, deer, and tigers are
sacred animal, both a valuable source of food and a sacrifice, containing
supernatural powers. If worshiped, the jungler will avoid disaster
when exploiting natural products. And over the years, festivals, religions,
beliefs, taking place vibrantly in all regions and regions of the country. excitement,
The bustle of folk religious activities contributes to meeting the needs of people

by the stimuli he perceives from his surroundings.
Similar to the natural landscape, the cultural landscape also needs to be
protected. Protection of the natural landscape is the conservation and maintenance of the form,

The worship of animals is due to natural human curiosity.
Primitive man observed an animal with unique and inexplicable characteristics
Its likeability will appeal to human curiosity, curiosity is the result of
early man's observations of this particular feature and this wonder

User program execution begins with one or more nested blocks
optional boot function (OB), is executed once while entering RUN mode, and
followed by one or more program cycle OBs that are executed one
cyclic way. The OB can also be associated with an interrupt event, which can be an event
standard interrupt or an error event, and execute whenever the standard or error event occurs
The corresponding error event occurs.
A function (FC) or function block (FB) is a block of program code that can be called
from an OB or from another FC or FB, down to the following levels.
FC is not associated with any part of a data block (DB), while FB
is directly attached to a DB and uses the DB to forward messages
numbers and stores temporary values ​​and results.
Size of user program, of data and of configurable
limited by available load memory and working memory in the CPU. There are no limits
for the number of blocks supported within the available working memory.
Each cycle consists of writing outputs, reading input, the execution of
user program instructions, and performing system or process maintenance
background logic. Cycle is referred to as one scan cycle or one scan.
Signal boards, signal modules and communication modules are recognized
and recorded only while the power is on.
Under the default configuration, all analog and digital I/O points are updated
updated synchronously with the scan cycle using an internal memory area
is called the process image. The process image contains a snapshot of inputs and outputs
physical output (I/O points on the CPU, on the signal board, and on the signal modules).
This cycle provides consistent logic throughout the execution of instructions
user for a given cycle and prevent flickering of the points
output, which can change state many times in the process image output area.
You can specify when numeric and analog I/O points are stored
in the progress image. If we insert a module in the device view, the data of
it is located in the progress image of the S7-1200 CPU (default). The CPU executes the change
Exchange data between the module and the progress image area automatically during the update
update of the progress image. To remove numeric or analog points from the update
automatically update the process image, we select the corresponding device in the Device configuration,
view the Properties tab, expand if necessary to set the desired I/O points, and then select
select “IO addresses/HW identifier”. Then change the entry for “Process image:”
from “Cyclic PI” to “---”. To add points back to the automatic update of the progress image,
change this selection back to “Cyclic PI”.
We can read input values ​​and write output values ​​immediately when a
execute command. An instant read will access the current state of the object input
handle and do not update the process image input region, regardless of whether a point is configured
image to be stored in the progress image. An instantaneous write to the physical output will update
Update the entire progress image output area (if a point is configured to be stored in
process image) and physical output point. We append the suffix ":P" to the I/O address if desired
The program immediately retrieves I/O data directly from the physical point instead
for using progress images.
The CPU performs a hot reboot before entering RUN mode. The
hot reboot will reset all retained memories to default boot values
specified, but keep the current values ​​stored in retained memory.
When you download a project element (such as a program block, a data block,
data or hardware configuration), the CPU performs a reboot during the switch
next to RUN mode. In addition to clearing inputs, initialize outputs and
initialize non-retainable memory, restart also activates
memory area that can be retained.
After a reboot following the download, all STOP conversions to
Sequential RUN will also perform a hot reboot (without triggering the memory
capable of holding).
The CPU supports a hot reboot to enter RUN mode. Restart
hot does not include a memory reset. All systems are not capable of keeping
and user data are both initialized at a hot reboot. Data
the user's ability to keep remains the same.
A reset memory erases all working memories, erasing possible memory areas
hold and non-hold, and copy the loaded memory to the working memory. One
memory reset does not erase diagnostic buffers or permanently stored values
of the IP address.
You can specify the CPU's power-on mode complete with the initialization method
restart using programming software. This configuration icon appears
in the Device Configuration section for the CPU in boot. When the source is
turned on, the CPU performs a sequence of power-on and system initialization diagnostic tests
system. The CPU will then go into power-on mode accordingly. Of course errors are detected
will now prevent the CPU from entering RUN mode. CPU supports power-on modes
The following.
When the operating state changes from STOP to RUN, the CPU clears the inputs
process image, initialize process image outputs, and execute startup OBs. Real
Any reads access the progress image inputs by instructions in the OBs
start will read zero value rather than the current physical input value. Therefore, to read
the current state of a physical input during boot mode, we must
perform an instant read. Start-up OBs and any associated FCs and FBs
authority will be executed next. If more than 1 startup OB exists, each of those OBs
will be executed in OB number order, in which the lowest OB number is executed
Firstly.
Each startup OB includes startup information that helps us determine validity
of the data stored and of the clock hour of the day. You can program commands n
in the startup OBs to check these startup values ​​and to perform the operation
fit. The following boot regions are supported by boot OBs.
For each scan cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the inputs, executes the program
user program, update communication modules, perform internal translation work
(housekeeping) and respond to user interrupt events and transmission requests
pine. Communication requests are processed periodically throughout the process
to scan.
These operations (except user interrupt events) are performed
regularly and in a sequential order. User interrupt events are fired
Activities will be served with priority in the order in which they appear.
The system guarantees that the scan cycle will be completed within a period of time
is called the maximum cycle time, otherwise a time error event will be generated
out.
 Each scan cycle begins by looking up the current values ​​of the outputs
digital or analog from the process image and then write them to the outputs
physical CPU, the SB and SM modules are configured for automatic I/O updates
dynamic (default configuration). When a physical output is accessed by an instruction,
both the output process image and the physical output itself are updated.
The scan cycle continues by reading the current values ​​of the digital inputs
or the like from the CPU, the SB, SM modules are configured for updating
I/O automatically (default configuration), and then writes these values ​​to the progress image
submit. When a physical input is accessed by an instruction, the value of input
The physical image is accessed, but the input process image is not updated.
 After reading the inputs, the user program is executed from the first instruction
first to the last command. This includes all chapter cycle OBs
program plus all their associated FCs and FBs. Cyclic OBs
The program is executed in order of OB number, where OB number is low
is executed first.Processing of communications occurs periodically throughout the process
scan, which can interrupt the execution of the user program.
Self-diagnostic tests include periodic checks of the system and
check the status of the I/O module.
Interrupts can occur during any part of the scan cycle, and are
event driven. When an event occurs, the CPU interrupts the scan cycle and calls OB .
configured to execute that event. After the OB finishes executing the event,
The CPU resumes the execution of the user program at the breakpoint.
OBs control the execution of the user program. Each OB must have
a unique OB number. Some default OB numbers are reversed under the value
200. Other OBs must be numbered 200 or greater.
Specific events in the CPU trigger the execution of an organization block.
OBs cannot call each other or be called from an FC or FB. There is only one event
startup, such as a diagnostic interrupt or a time interval, is possible
animate the execution of an OB. The CPU processes OBs according to their respective priority classes
them, where OBs with higher priority are processed before OBs with higher priority
lower priority. The lowest priority class is 1 (for the main program cycle), and class
highest priority is 27 (for timing error interrupts).
Program cycle OBs execute cyclically while the CPU is at
RUN mode. The main block of the program is a program cycle OB. Here
is where we put the program control instructions and also where we call blocks
additional users. Multiple program cycle OBs are allowed and allowed
executed in numerical order. OB 1 is the default. Program cycle OBs
other must be identified as OB 200 or greater.
 OBs delay execution at a specified dwell time
after an event, configured by the start interrupt command (SRT_DINT).
The delay time is specified in the input parameter of the extend instruction.
CPU processing is controlled by events. Events that trigger the
OB interrupt to be executed. The interrupt OB for an event is specified during the process
create the block, either in Device Configuration or with an ATTACH command or
DETACH. Some events occur on a background with a cycle-like system
program or cyclical events. Other events that only happen in one
short durations, like the start-up and time-delay events. Some
event occurs when there is a hardware-triggered change, such as a
threshold event on an input point or a high-speed counter event. Addition
there are events such as diagnostic error events and time error events that occur only when there is a
error. Event priorities, groups, and priorities are used to determine order
self-handling for event interrupt OBs.
Program cycle event occurs once during each program cycle
(or scan cycle). During the program cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the
entering and executing program cycle OBs. Program cycle event is required
and is always enabled. We may not have program cycle OBs, or have
Multiple OBs are selected for each program cycle event. After the cycle event
program is activated, the lowest numbered program cycle OB (usually
is OB 1) will be executed. Other program cycle OBs are executed
sequentially, in numbered order, only during the program cycle.
Cyclic interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupt at a configured interval. Configurable interval when OB
generated and selected to become a cyclic interrupt OB. Events
cyclic interrupt will interrupt the program cycle and execute the cyclic interrupt OB (event
cyclic events are in a higher priority group than program cycle events).
Only one cyclic interrupt OB can be attached to a cyclic event
submit. The CPU supports 4 cyclic interrupt events. Cyclic interrupt OBs have a
phase shift property, so execution of cyclic interrupts in cycle
The same time can be shifted from one time to another by one degree of shift
phase adjustment.
The startup event occurs once on the STOP to RUN transition and
causes the startup OB to be executed. Multiple OBs can be selected for the trigger event
motion. Startup OBs are executed in numbered order.
Time-delayed interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupts after a delay has elapsed. The delay time is determined with
SRT_DINT command. Time delay events interrupt the program cycle to execute
Time delay interrupt OB exam. Only one time delay interrupt OB is possible
attached to a time delay event. The CPU supports 4 time delay events.
Hardware interrupt events are triggered by a change in the
hard, for example a threshold tgain or threshold drop on an input point, or an event
HSC case. There can be one interrupt OB selected for each hardware interrupt event. The
Hardware events are allowed in the Device configuration section. OBs are identified
specified for an event in the Device configuration or with an ATTACH instruction in the
user program. The CPU supports several hardware interrupt events. Exact events
is based on the CPU type and number of input points.
The diagnostic error interrupt and timing error interrupt events are triggered when the CPU
detected an error. These events are in a higher priority group than events
other interrupts and can interrupt the execution of hardware interrupt delay events, periodic interrupts
program and time delay interrupt. An interrupt OB can be defined for each event
in the diagnostic and timing error interrupt events.
The number of waiting (queuing) events from a single source is limited to
using a different row for each event type. Under reaching the limit of events
wait event for a given event type, the next event will be lost.
Each CPU event has an associated priority, and the priorities are assigned
classified into priority groups. The following table summarizes the queuing depths, the
priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB
event) is approximately 210 microseconds, indicating that a program cycle OB is only
the event handler subroutine fires at the time of the interrupt event.
The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle
does not complete within the specified maximum scan cycle time.
The requested OB cannot be initialized condition occurs when an OB is
requested by a cyclic interrupt or a time delay interrupt, but the OB is
That request has just been executed.
Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type. If an event occurs
When the corresponding queue is full, a time error event is generated.
All timing error events will trigger the execution of OB 80, if any. If
OB 80 does not exist, the CPU will ignore this error. If the two dark cycle time conditions
exceeded occurs in the same program cycle without resetting the timer
then cycle, CPU will go into STOP mode, regardless of whether OB 80 exists or not.
OB 80 includes startup information that helps you determine which events and OBs have
generate error. You can program a script inside OB 80 to check initialization values
this action and to take the appropriate action. The following boot regions are supported
by OB 80:
All diagnostic error events will trigger the execution of OB 82 if it exists
in. If OB 82 does not exist, the CPU will then ignore the error. No OB 82 interrupt error
What diagnostics are present when you create a project. If desired, we add an OB 82 interrupt
Diagnostic error into the project by double clicking on “Add new block” below
“Program blocks”, then select “Organization block” and “Diagnostic error interrupt”.
OB 82 includes trigger information that helps us determine when an event is based
on the occurrence or removal of an error, and the device and channel that reported the error.
Bit 4 of IO_state indicates when the event was caused by occurrence or removal
of an error. Bit 4 will be 1 if an error is present (e.g. wire break) and 0 if error
not present.
The ladder input contains the hardware identifier (HW ID) of the device or units
function location returns an error. HW IDs are assigned automatically when components are
inserted into the device or network view and appears in the Constants tab of the recording cards
PLCs. A name is also automatically assigned to the HW ID. These entries
in the Constants tag of the PLC tags cannot be changed.
The channel number starts at 0 for the first input point (analog type
or digital) and starts at 64 for the first output point (analog or
numeric type). Various corrections are needed to distinguish the inputs from the
output in the event that the device contains both. If an error affects the complete equipment
tuning and functional units, i.e. without a source, the most significant bit of
channel number character to be set (channel number 32768).
The RE_TRIGR instruction (re-enable cycle time monitoring) allows us to
reset the timer then measure the cycle time. However, this command only works if it
is executed in an OB program cycle; RE_TRIGR command will be ignored if
is executed in OB 80. If the maximum scan cycle time is exceeded twice
in the same program cycle without RE_TRIGR instruction execution between both
twice, the CPU will then switch back to STOP immediately. The use of iterative executions
The repetition of the RE_TRIGR instruction can create an infinite loop or a very long scan cycle
long.
Usually, the scan cycle executes as fast as possible and the next scan
next starts as soon as the current scan cycle is complete. Depends on the program
user and communication tasks, the cycle time of each scan cycle can be
may vary between scan cycles. To eliminate this difference, the CPU supports a
Optional fixed minimum scan cycle time (also known as fixed scan cycle). When this optional function is activated and a scan cycle time is dark
fixed min is provided in milliseconds, CPU will maintain min cycle time
within ±1 ms for the completion of each CPU scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU completes the normal scan cycle in
time is less than the predetermined minimum scan cycle time, the CPU will use
additional scan cycle time to perform uptime diagnostics
and/or to process communication requests. In this way the CPU always takes a
fixed amount of time to complete a scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU is unable to complete the scan cycle within
Minimum cycle time is specified, the CPU will complete the scan cycle normally
normally (including communication processing) and does not generate any system response
as a result of exceeding the minimum scan time.
Load memory is a non-volatile storage area for human programs
usage, data and configuration. When a project is downloaded to the CPU, it first
stored in the load memory area. This area is placed in both a card
memory (if any) or in the CPU. This non-volatile memory is still maintained
when the power is lost. The memory card supports a larger storage space than the storage area
storage built into the CPU.
Working memory is a storage area for some elements of a human project
used while executing the user program. CPU copies a number
elements in the project from memory loaded into working memory. Variable Memory
This is lost when power is lost, and it is stored by the CPU when power is restored
restore.
Retained memory is a non-volatile storage area for a limited number of
limit working memory values. Retained memory area used for storage
values ​​of user-selected memory locations during
sourceless space. When the power is turned on again, the CPU has enough time to hold on
to maintain the values ​​of a limited number of special memory locations. The prices
This retained value is then restored when the power is turned on.
Bit memory (M): we can determine the exact width of memory for each tuple
Remember the bit in the PLC tag table or in the assignment list. Storage bit memory
always starts at MB0 and runs up successively to a specified number of
bytes. We determine this value from the PLC tag table or from the assignment list by
clicking on the “Retain” icon. Enter the number of bytes M to hold
start again at MB0.
Tags in a function block (FB): if a function block is created with box
“Symbolic access only” is selected, the editor interface for this FB then
will contain a column “Retain”. In this column, you can choose both “Retain” or
“Non-retain” separately for each record tag. An Instant DB has been created
output when this FB is placed in the editor will show this retain column, but
for display purposes only; We cannot change the save state from within the program
compose an instant DB interface for an FB that has been configured as
“Symbolic access only”.
If a FB was created with the “Symbolic access only” box unchecked,
This theme editor for FB will not include a “Retain” column. An Instant DB
was created when this FB was inserted in the editor the program will show
see an editable “Retain” column. In this case, choosing option
“Retain” for any tag will result in all tags selected.
Similarly, canceling the option selection for any tag will result in
All recording cards are deselected. For a configured FB that is not
“Symbolic access only”, we have tTo change the retention state from within the submission scope
instant DB editing, but all tags will be set to hold
together.
After creating FB, one cannot change the option for “Symbolic access
only”. This option can only be selected when the FB is created. To determine when
an existing FB configured for “Symbolic access only”, right click on FB
In the Project tree, select “Properties”, and then select “Attributes”.
A total of 2048 bytes of data can be held. To see how many bytes, word
PLC tab sheet or from the assignment list, click on the toolbar icon
"Retain". The second line will show the total remaining memory combined for M and DB, though
although this is where the retention ranges are defined for M.
The CPU supports a diagnostic buffer containing one entry per event
diagnose. Each entry includes the date and time the event occurred, a list of
event entry and an event description. The entries are displayed in order
time with the most recent event at the top. While the CPU maintains power, there is
The most recent 50 events are in this log. When the log is full, a new event will
replace the longest occurring event in the log. When the source is lost, 10 recent events
will be saved.
The CPU supports one hour of the day clock. A large capacitor provides power
amount required to keep the clock running for the duration that the CPU is powered off. Capacitors
This power is charged while the CPU is powered up. Arrive at least 2 hours after the CPU has
powered off, this large capacitor will be fully charged to keep the meter running for
Usually about 10 days.
Time of Day Clock is set according to the system time which is time
Coordinate Universal Time (UTC). There are commands to read system time
system (RD_SYS_T) or local time (RD_LOC_T). Local time is calculated in
how to use time zone and daylight saving correction that we set in
Device configuration section CPU Clock section.
We configure the hour of day clock for the CPU under the “Time of .” property
day". You can also activate daylight saving time and define the times
start and stop points for daylight saving time. To set up copper
hour of the day, you must be online and in the “Online &
Diagnostics” of the CPU. Use the “Set time of day” function.
The CPU initializes these bytes on the transition from STOP mode to mode
STARTUP. The bits of the timer memory change synchronously to the clock
CPU throughout STARTUP and RUN modes.
Each level allows known functions to be accessible without
a password. The default condition for the CPU is to have no restrictions and no
there is a password protection. To limit access to a CPU, we configure
Display the CPU properties and enter the password.
Entering a password over a network will not reduce the value of the password
password protection for the CPU. A password protected CPU allows only
unrestricted access to one user at a time. Secret protection
The password does not apply to the execution of the user program script including
communication functions. Entering the correct password will provide access to all
all functions.
PLC to PLC communication (using communication instruction set in code blocks)
is not restricted by the security level in the CPU. The HMI function is also not affected
limit.
STEP 7 Basic software facilitates symbolic programming. Pine
Usually, tags are created both in the PLC tag, in a data block, or in
interface at the top of an OB, FC or FB. These tags include name, data type,
data, corrections and legends. In addition, in a data block, an initial value has
can be established. You can use these tags when programming by entering
tag name in command parameter. Optionally, we can also enter the operand
independent (memory, device, size and offset) at the instruction parameter. Examples in
The following shows how to enter absolute operands. The % character is spelled
dynamically inserted before the absolute operand by the program editor. I can flip
change the view mode in the program editor to one of the following:
symbol (Symbolic), symbol and absolute (Symbolic and absolute) or absolute
(Absolute).
By adding “:P” to an address, we can immediately read the
to the digital or analog type of the CPU, SB, or SM. The difference between a retrieval
using I_:P instead of using I is that the data will come directly from the points
being accessed rather than from the input process image. Retrieve the referenced I_:P
to an “immediate read” access because the data is retrieved immediately from the source
rather than from a copy that was made the last time the input progress image
updated.
Since the physical input points receive their data directly from the field devices are connected to these points, writing to these points is prohibited.
That is to say, I_:P accesses are read-only, as opposed to I-accessibles
read or write.
I_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the possible inputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the inputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at I4.0, then
The input points can be accessed by addresses I4.0:P and I4.1:P or by IB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from I4.2:P through I4.7:P are not denied, but are not
are recognized, since these points are not used. Accesses to the IW4:P . address
and ID4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with the SB.
Since the physical output points directly control the connected field devices
to these points, reading from these points is prohibited. That means, the
Q_:P outputs are write-only, as opposed to Q accesses which can be read or written.
Q_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the outputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the outputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at Q4.0, then
Output points can be accessed by address Q4.0:P and Q4.1:P or by QB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from Q4.2:P to Q4.7:P are not denied, but
are not recognized, as these points are not used. Accesses to address
QW4:P and QD4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with SB.
Data types are used to specify the size of a data element
data as well as the manner in which the data is interpreted. Each command parameter supports at least
one data type, and some parameters also support multiple data types. We keep the pointer over
the parameter field of a command to see what data types are supported for a message
given number.
A formal parameter is an identifier on an instruction that marks the location of data
data used by that instruction (e.g. the IN1 input of an ADD instruction). Actual parameters
is actually a memory location or constant containing data used for an instruction (eg %MD400
“Number_of_Widgets”). The data type of the actual parameter is specified by the user
must match one of the official spec's supported data types
specified by the command.
When specifying an actual parameter, you must specify either a tag (symbol) or
an absolute memory address. Tags associated with a symbol name (tag name)
with a data type, a device, memory offset, and comment line, and can
created either in the PLC tag editor or in the Interface editor
for a block (OB, FC, FB or DB). If entering an absolute address without
tag related, one must use an appropriate size for the data type
supported, and a default tag will be created under the entry.
You can also enter constant values ​​for multiple input parameters. The following table
This describes the basic data types supported, including examples of fixed entry.
All types except String are available in the PLC tag editor
and in the block's Interface editor. The String type is only available in the editor
Draft the interface of the block. The following table defines the basic data types.
Real numbers (or floating point numbers) are displayed as numbers with precision
32-bit single-precision (Real) or 64-bit double-precision number (LReal) as described in
ANSI/IEEE 754-1985 standard. Single precision floating point numbers
accurate to up to 6 significant digits and double precision floating point numbers
is accurate to up to 15 significant digits. You can specify up to 6 significant digits
(Real type) or 15 significant digits (LReal) when entering a floating point constant
to maintain accuracy.
Calculations involving a long sequence of values ​​consisting of very large numbers or
very small can produce inaccurate results. This can occur if the numbers
less than 10 to the power of x, where x > 6 (Real type) or x > 15 (LReal type).
Example for Real: 100 000 000 + 1 = 100 000 000.
CPU supports String data type for storing a sequence of single byte characters
odd. The String data type contains a total character counter (the number of characters in the string) and
current character counter. String type provides up to 256 bytes for storing results
maximum total character count (1 byte), current character count result (1 byte) and max
254 characters, where each character is stored in 1 byte.
We can use orthogonal strings (constants) for command parameters of type
IN using single quotes. For example, a 3-character string 'ABC' might
is used as input to the IN parameter of the S_CONV instruction. You can also create string variables by selecting the data type “String” in the interface editor
blocks for OB, FC, FB and DB. You cannot create a string in the tag editor
take noteof PLCs. You can specify the maximum string size in bytes when declaring
string, for example, “MyString[10]” will specify a maximum size of 10 bytes for MyString.
If the square brackets are not included with the maximum size indicator, the value 254 will
Send.
The following example defines a string with a maximum character count of 10 and the value
current character count equals 3. This means that currently the string contains 3 1 byte characters,
but can be expanded to hold up to 10 1-byte characters.
