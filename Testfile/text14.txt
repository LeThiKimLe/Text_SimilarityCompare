scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his
arm he carried a lime-green bowler.

“That’s Dad’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, the Min-
ister of Magic!”

Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his
chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.
“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones.
“Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things’ve gone far enough. Ministry’s got to act.”
“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore.
“You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir —”

“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confi-
dence,” said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.

“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid’s record’s

against him. Ministry’s got to do something — the school gover-
nors have been in touch —”

“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not
help in the slightest,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of
a fire Harry had never seen before.
“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his

bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing some-
thing. If it turns out it wasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said.

But I’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my duty —”
“Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me where?”
“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid’s eyes.
“Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is
caught, you’ll be let out with a full apology —”

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

 262 
“Not Azkaban?” croaked Hagrid.
Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the
door.
Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry’s turn for an elbow in the
ribs; he’d let out an audible gasp.
Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed in a long
black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang
started to growl.
“Already here, Fudge,” he said approvingly. “Good, good . . .”
“What’re you doin’ here?” said Hagrid furiously. “Get outta my
house!”

“My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in be-
ing inside your — er — d’you call this a house?” said Lucius Mal-
foy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. “I simply called

at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.”

“And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?” said Dum-
bledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue

eyes.
“Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily, taking out a
long roll of parchment, “but the governors feel it’s time for you to
step aside. This is an Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve
signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your touch. How
many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon,
wasn’t it? At this rate, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts,
and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.”
“Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking alarmed,
“Dumbledore suspended — no, no — last thing we want just
now —”

CORNELIUS FUDGE

 263 

“The appointment — or suspension — of the headmaster is a
matter for the governors, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. “And
as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks —”
“See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can’t stop them,” said Fudge,
whose upper lip was sweating now, “I mean to say, who can?”
“That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile.
“But as all twelve of us have voted —”

Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceil-
ing.

“An’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an’ blackmail before
they agreed, Malfoy, eh?” he roared.
“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into

trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr. Malfoy. “I would ad-
vise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won’t

like it at all.”
“Yeh can’ take Dumbledore!” yelled Hagrid, making Fang the
boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. “Take him away, an’
the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chance! There’ll be killin’ next!”
“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore sharply. He looked
at Lucius Malfoy.
“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step
aside —”
“But —” stuttered Fudge.
“No!” growled Hagrid.

Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Mal-
foy’s cold gray ones.

“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly
so that none of them could miss a word, “you will find that I will

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

 264 

only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You
will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those
who ask for it.”
For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore’s eyes flickered
toward the corner where he and Ron stood hidden.
“Admirable sentiments,” said Malfoy, bowing. “We shall all miss
your — er — highly individual way of running things, Albus, and
only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any — ah —
killins.”
He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore
out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead
of him, but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said
carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they’d have
ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That’d lead ’em right! That’s
all I’m sayin’.”
Fudge stared at him in amazement.
“All right, I’m comin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin
overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he
stopped again and said loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang
while I’m away.”
The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.
“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No Dumbledore.
They might as well close the school tonight. There’ll be an attack a
day with him gone.”
Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door.

ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky

and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cab-
bages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid vis-
ible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his

heels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than
the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.
Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were
now barred from the hospital wing.

“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Pomfrey told them se-
verely through a crack in the infirmary door. “No, I’m sorry, there’s

every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people
off. . . .”
With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that

the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mul-
lioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school

S

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 266 

that didn’t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang
through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was
quickly stifled.
Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore’s final words to himself.
“I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to
me. . . . Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for

it.” But what good were these words? Who exactly were they sup-
posed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and

scared as they were?
Hagrid’s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand —
the trouble was, there didn’t seem to be a single spider left in the
castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather
reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact
that they weren’t allowed to wander off on their own but had to
move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most

of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shep-
herded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irk-
some.

One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the at-
mosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting

around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy.
Harry didn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions
lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left,
when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating
to Crabbe and Goyle.

“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dum-
bledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you

he thinks Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever

ARAGOG

 267 

had. Maybe we’ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who
won’t want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won’t last
long, she’s only filling in. . . .”
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s
empty seat and cauldron.

“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for the head-
master’s job?”

“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a
thin-lipped smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended
by the governors. I daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”

“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Fa-
ther’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I’ll tell Father

you’re the best teacher here, sir —”
Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately
not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into
his cauldron.
“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed their bags
by now,” Malfoy went on. “Bet you five Galleons the next one dies.
Pity it wasn’t Granger —”
The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy’s last
words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect
bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.
“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his
arms. “I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him
with my bare hands —”
“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked Snape
over the class’s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and
Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 268 

safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle
and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward
the greenhouses.
The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two
missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.
Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian
Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the

compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmil-
lan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want

to say, Harry, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you’d
never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I
said. We’re all in the same boat now, and, well —”
He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig
as Harry and Ron.
“That Draco Malfoy character,” said Ernie, breaking off dead
twigs, “he seems very pleased about all this, doesn’t he? D’you
know, I think he might be Slytherin’s heir.”

“That’s clever of you,” said Ron, who didn’t seem to have for-
given Ernie as readily as Harry.

“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked.
“No,” said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.
A second later, Harry spotted something.
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other
side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though
taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron
over the hand with his pruning shears.
“Ouch! What’re you —”

ARAGOG

 269 

Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his
eyes screwed up against the sun.
“Oh, yeah,” said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. “But
we can’t follow them now —”
Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.

Harry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pur-
sued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they

would end up.
“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest. . . .”
And Ron looked even unhappier about that.
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to
their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged
behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.
“We’ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry told Ron.
“We can take Fang with us. He’s used to going into the forest with
Hagrid, he might be some help.”
“Right,” said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his

fingers. “Er — aren’t there — aren’t there supposed to be were-
wolves in the forest?” he added as they took their usual places at the

back of Lockhart’s classroom.
Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, “There are

good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the uni-
corns . . .”

Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had
entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.
Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him.
Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual,
but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 270 

“Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all these
long faces?”
People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.
“Don’t you people realize,” said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as
though they were all a bit dim, “the danger has passed! The culprit
has been taken away —”
“Says who?” said Dean Thomas loudly.
“My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn’t have
taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred percent sure that he
was guilty,” said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that
one and one made two.
“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.
“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid’s arrest than
you do, Mr. Weasley,” said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.
Ron started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped
in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.
“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.

But Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had al-
ways thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole

business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he
yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid
face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron:
Let’s do it tonight.
Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at
the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to
stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.
The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these
days, because from six o’clock onward the Gryffindors had no-

ARAGOG

 271 

where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result
that the common room often didn’t empty until past midnight.

Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right af-
ter dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room

to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few

games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very sub-
dued in Hermione’s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on pur-
pose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well

past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory
doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves,
and climbing through the portrait hole.
It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all
the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the
lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop
any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.
“ ’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black
grass, “we might get to the forest and find there’s nothing to follow.
Those spiders might not’ve been going there at all. I know it looked
like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but . . .”
His voice trailed away hopefully.
They reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking with its
blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went
mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake
everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily
fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued
his teeth together.
Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table. There would
be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 272 

“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry, patting his
leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them,
dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large
sycamore tree.
Harry took out his wand, murmured, “Lumos!” and a tiny light
appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path
for signs of spiders.
“Good thinking,” said Ron. “I’d light mine, too, but you
know — it’d probably blow up or something. . . .”
Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two
solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the
shade of the trees.
“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, “I’m ready.
Let’s go.”
So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and
leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry’s wand, they
followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They

walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, lis-
tening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves.

Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars
overhead were no longer visible, and Harry’s wand shone alone in
the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.
Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but
everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He
had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly
remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time
he’d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting
in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.

ARAGOG

 273 

Something wet touched Harry’s hand and he jumped backward,
crushing Ron’s foot, but it was only Fang’s nose.
“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could
just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.
“We’ve come this far,” said Ron.
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the
trees. They couldn’t move very quickly now; there were tree roots
and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry
could feel Fang’s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had
to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in
the wandlight.
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their
robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while,
they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward,
though the trees were as thick as ever.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making
both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.
“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark,
and gripping Harry’s elbow very hard.

“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Lis-
ten . . . sounds like something big. . . .”

They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big
was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”
“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”
“Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already
heard Fang!”
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 274 

stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and
then silence.
“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.
“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.
“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.
“Dunno —”
Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in
the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their
eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of
thorns and yelped even louder.
“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief. “Harry, it’s
our car!”
“What?”
“Come on!”

Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and trip-
ping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.

Mr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle
of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze.
As Ron walked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward
him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.
“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly, walking
around the car. “Look at it. The forest’s turned it wild. . . .”

The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Ap-
parently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own.

Fang didn’t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who
could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry
stuffed his wand back into his robes.

ARAGOG

 275 

“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, leaning
against the car and patting it. “I wondered where it had gone!”
Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more

spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the head-
lights.

“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find them.”
Ron didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed on a point
some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face
was livid with terror.
Harry didn’t even have time to turn around. There was a loud
clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize
him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was
hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking,
and saw Ron’s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering
and howling — next moment, he was being swept away into the
dark trees.

Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was march-
ing on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him

tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could
hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were
moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang
fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but
Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to
have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.
He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he
only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see

that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Cran-
ing his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 276 

a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the
stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.
Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.
Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,
gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its
way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very

center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, click-
ing their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.

Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him.
Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling
anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly
like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent
scream and his eyes were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him
was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked
his pincers with every word he spoke.
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size
of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the

black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pin-
cered head was milky white. He was blind.

“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes
wandering vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .”
“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to
have left his chest to pound in his throat.

ARAGOG

 277 

Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the
hollow.
Aragog paused.
“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said
slowly.
“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s
why we’ve come.”
“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard
concern beneath the clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”
Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he
didn’t think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the
ground, as calmly as he could.
“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a —
a — something on students. They’ve taken him to Azkaban.”

Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hol-
low the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like

applause, except applause didn’t usually make Harry feel sick with
fear.
“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years and years
ago. I remember it well. That’s why they made him leave the
school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what
they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had
opened the Chamber and set me free.”
“And you . . . you didn’t come from the Chamber of Secrets?”
said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.
“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in the castle. I
come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was
an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a
cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 278 

is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and
blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in
the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found
me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all
through Hagrid’s goodness. . . .”
Harry summoned what remained of his courage.
“So you never — never attacked anyone?”

“Never,” croaked the old spider. “It would have been my in-
stinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The

body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I
never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew
up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet. . . .”
“But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?” said Harry.
“Because whatever it is, it’s back and attacking people again —”
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the
rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes
shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient
creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how

I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast mov-
ing about the school.”

“What is it?” said Harry urgently.

More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be clos-
ing in.

“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name
it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature,
though he asked me, many times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders

ARAGOG

 279 

pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking.
He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders
continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.

“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hear-
ing leaves rustling behind him.

“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.
But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly
into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.”
Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid
wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly
black heads.
Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good,
there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die
fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed
through the hollow.
Mr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, headlights
glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were
thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The
car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors
flew open.
“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized
the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the
back of the car — the doors slammed shut — Ron didn’t touch the
accelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine roared and they
were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the
hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

 280 

whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through
the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.
Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the
silent scream, but his eyes weren’t popping anymore.
“Are you okay?”
Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.

They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howl-
ing loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off

as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes,
the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.
The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into
the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung
himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry
opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house,
tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so,
Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still

stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it re-
versed back into the forest and disappeared from view.

Harry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the Invisibility
Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When
Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the
pumpkin patch.
“Follow the spiders,” said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his
sleeve. “I’ll never forgive Hagrid. We’re lucky to be alive.”
“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his,” said
Harry.
“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping the wall
of the cabin. “He always thinks monsters aren’t as bad as they’re

ARAGOG

made out, and look where it’s got him! A cell in Azkaban!” He was
shivering uncontrollably now. “What was the point of sending us
in there? What have we found out, I’d like to know?”
“That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,” said
Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm
to make him walk. “He was innocent.”
Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard
wasn’t his idea of being innocent.
As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make
sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors
ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up
the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors
where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the
safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned
itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the
winding stair to their dormitory.
Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry,

however, didn’t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his four-
poster, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.

The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he
thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other
monsters didn’t want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to
finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid
had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his
pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower
window.
He couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of
Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same
person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.
There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about
what Aragog had said.
He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last
hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.
“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron —”
Ron woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw
Harry.
“Ron — that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a
bathroom,” said Harry, ignoring Neville’s snuffling snores from the
corner. “What if she never left the bathroom? What if she’s still
there?”
Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And
then he understood, too.
“You don’t think — not Moaning Myrtle?”

THE CHAMBER
OF SECRETS

ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just
three toilets away,” said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,
“and we could’ve asked her, and now . . .”
It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping
their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls’ bathroom, the girls’
bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was
going to be almost impossible.
But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration,
that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first
time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall
told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one
week from today.
“Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still getting exams?”
There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom’s
wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professor
A

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,
frowning, to Seamus.
“The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for
you to receive your education,” she said sternly. “The exams will
therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.”
Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would
be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of
mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor
McGonagall scowl even more darkly.
“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school
running as normally as possible,” she said. “And that, I need hardly
point out, means finding out how much you have learned this
year.”
Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed
to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year?
He couldn’t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an
exam.
Ron looked as though he’d just been told he had to go and live
in the Forbidden Forest.
“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he asked Harry,
holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.

Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made an-
other announcement at breakfast.

“I have good news,” she said, and the Great Hall, instead of
falling silent, erupted.
“Dumbledore’s coming back!” several people yelled joyfully.
“You’ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!” squealed a girl at the
Ravenclaw table.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 285 

“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood excitedly.
When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said,
“Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready
for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people
who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of
them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am

hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the cul-
prit.”

There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the
Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy
hadn’t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he’d
looked in days.
“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he said to
Harry. “Hermione’ll probably have all the answers when they wake

her up! Mind you, she’ll go crazy when she finds out we’ve got ex-
ams in three days’ time. She hasn’t studied. It might be kinder to

leave her where she is till they’re over.”
Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron.
She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands
were twisting in her lap.
“What’s up?” said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.
Ginny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down the
Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded
Harry of someone, though he couldn’t think who.
“Spit it out,” said Ron, watching her.

Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rock-
ing backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby

did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden in-
formation.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 286 

“I’ve got to tell you something,” Ginny mumbled, carefully not
looking at Harry.
“What is it?” said Harry.
Ginny looked as though she couldn’t find the right words.
“What?” said Ron.
Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned
forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear
him.
“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen
something? Someone acting oddly?”
Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy
Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan.
“If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m starving,
I’ve only just come off patrol duty.”
Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified,
gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy
sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.

“Percy!” said Ron angrily. “She was just about to tell us some-
thing important!”

Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.
“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing.
“I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she started to
say —”

“Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber of Se-
crets,” said Percy at once.

“How do you know?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised.
“Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the
other day when I was — well, never mind — the point is, she spot-

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 287 

ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it

to anybody. I must say, I did think she’d keep her word. It’s noth-
ing, really, I’d just rather —”

Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.
“What were you doing, Percy?” said Ron, grinning. “Go on, tell
us, we won’t laugh.”
Percy didn’t smile back.
“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.”
Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without

their help, but he wasn’t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myr-
tle if it turned up — and to his delight it did, midmorning, when

they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.
Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had

passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheart-
edly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them

safely down the corridors. His hair wasn’t as sleek as usual; it
seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth
floor.
“Mark my words,” he said, ushering them around a corner. “The
first words out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It
was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks
all these security measures are necessary.”
“I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.
“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while they waited
for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. “I mean, we teachers have
quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to
classes and standing guard all night. . . .”
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 288 

“That’s right,” said Ron, catching on. “Why don’t you leave us
here, sir, we’ve only got one more corridor to go —”
“You know, Weasley, I think I will,” said Lockhart. “I really
should go and prepare my next class —”
And he hurried off.
“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him. “Gone to curl his
hair, more like.”
They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then

darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myr-
tle’s bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on

their brilliant scheme —
“Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?”
It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of
thin lines.
“We were — we were —” Ron stammered. “We were going
to — to go and see —”
“Hermione,” said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both
looked at him.

“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went on hur-
riedly, treading on Ron’s foot, “and we thought we’d sneak into the

hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly
ready and, er, not to worry —”

Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a mo-
ment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she

spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.
“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening
in her beady eye. “Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on
the friends of those who have been . . . I quite understand. Yes,

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 289 

Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Profes-
sor Binns where you’ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my

permission.”
Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they’d
avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard
Professor McGonagall blow her nose.
“That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you’ve ever come
up with.”
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell
Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall’s permission
to visit Hermione.
Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.
“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified person,” she said, and
they had to admit she had a point when they’d taken their seats

next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn’t have the faint-
est inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell

her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said Ron, looking
sadly at Hermione’s rigid face. “Because if he sneaked up on them
all, no one’ll ever know. . . .”

But Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was more in-
terested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets,

and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched in-
side her fist.

Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he
pointed this out to Ron.
“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he
blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 290 

It was no easy task. Hermione’s hand was clamped so tightly
around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While
Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several
tense minutes, the paper came free.
It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed
it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.
Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,
there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk,
known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may
reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born
from a chicken’s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of

killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and ven-
omous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who

are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death.
Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy,
and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster,
which is fatal to it.
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand
Harry recognized as Hermione’s. Pipes.
It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his
brain.
“Ron,” he breathed. “This is it. This is the answer. The monster
in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant serpent! That’s why I’ve been
hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it.
It’s because I understand Parseltongue. . . .”
Harry looked up at the beds around him.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 291 

“The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one’s
died — because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it
through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it,
but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must’ve seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it,
but he couldn’t die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw
prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just
realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned
the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first!
And that girl pulled out her mirror — and —”
Ron’s jaw had dropped.
“And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly.

Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Hal-
loween.

“The water . . .” he said slowly. “The flood from Moaning Myr-
tle’s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection. . . .”

He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at
it, the more it made sense.
“. . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it!” he read aloud.
“Hagrid’s roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn’t want

one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spi-
ders flee before it! It all fits!”

“But how’s the basilisk been getting around the place?” said Ron.
“A giant snake . . . Someone would’ve seen . . .”
Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at
the foot of the page.
“Pipes,” he said. “Pipes . . . Ron, it’s been using the plumbing.
I’ve been hearing that voice inside the walls. . . .”

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 292 
Ron suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm.
“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said hoarsely.
“What if it’s a bathroom? What if it’s in —”
“— Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,” said Harry.
They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able
to believe it.
“This means,” said Harry, “I can’t be the only Parselmouth in
the school. The Heir of Slytherin’s one, too. That’s how he’s been
controlling the basilisk.”
“What’re we going to do?” said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.
“Should we go straight to McGonagall?”
“Let’s go to the staffroom,” said Harry, jumping up. “She’ll be
there in ten minutes. It’s nearly break.”
They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging
around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted
staffroom. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.
Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.
But the bell to signal break never came.

Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon-
agall’s voice, magically magnified.

“All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach-
ers return to the staffroom. Immediately, please.”

Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron.
“Not another attack? Not now?”
“What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast. “Go back to the dormitory?”
“No,” said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of
wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers’ cloaks. “In here. Let’s hear
what it’s all about. Then we can tell them what we’ve found out.”

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 293 

They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hun-
dreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging

open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the

teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puz-
zled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.

“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A student has
been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.”
Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her
hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard
and said, “How can you be sure?”
“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall, who was
very white, “left another message. Right underneath the first one.
‘Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.’ ”
Professor Flitwick burst into tears.
“Who is it?” said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed,
into a chair. “Which student?”
“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall.

Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor be-
side him.

“We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,” said
Professor McGonagall. “This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore
always said . . .”
The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment,
Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and
he was beaming.
“So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed?”
He didn’t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at
him with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 294 

“Just the man,” he said. “The very man. A girl has been snatched
by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself.
Your moment has come at last.”
Lockhart blanched.
“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout. “Weren’t

you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the en-
trance to the Chamber of Secrets is?”

“I — well, I —” sputtered Lockhart.
“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside
it?” piped up Professor Flitwick.
“D-did I? I don’t recall —”
“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had
a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,” said Snape.
“Didn’t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that
you should have been given a free rein from the first?”
Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.
“I — I really never — you may have misunderstood —”

“We’ll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,” said Professor McGona-
gall. “Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We’ll make sure

everyone’s out of your way. You’ll be able to tackle the monster all
by yourself. A free rein at last.”
Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the
rescue. He didn’t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was
trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked
weak-chinned and feeble.
“V-very well,” he said. “I’ll — I’ll be in my office, getting —
getting ready.”
And he left the room.
“Right,” said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 295 

“that’s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses
should go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them
the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow.
Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left
outside their dormitories.”
The teachers rose and left, one by one.
It was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life. He, Ron, Fred,
and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common
room, unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn’t there. He

had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut him-
self up in his dormitory.

No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor
Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and
George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.
“She knew something, Harry,” said Ron, speaking for the first
time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom. “That’s
why she was taken. It wasn’t some stupid thing about Percy at all.
She’d found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That
must be why she was —” Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. “I mean,
she was a pureblood. There can’t be any other reason.”
Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline.
This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something
they could do. Anything.
“Harry,” said Ron. “D’you think there’s any chance at all she’s
not — you know —”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t see how Ginny
could still be alive.
“D’you know what?” said Ron. “I think we should go and see

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 296 

Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going to try and get into
the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s
a basilisk in there.”
Because Harry couldn’t think of anything else to do, and because
he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors
around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys,
that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room,
and left through the portrait hole.
Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart’s office.
There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could
hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.
Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside.

Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lock-
hart’s eyes peering through it.

“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley —” he said, opening the
door a bit wider. “I’m rather busy at the moment — if you would
be quick —”
“Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said Harry.
“We think it’ll help you.”
“Er — well — it’s not terribly —” The side of Lockhart’s face
that they could see looked very uncomfortable. “I mean — well —
all right —”
He opened the door and they entered.
His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large

trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnight-
blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jum-
bled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the

walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 297 
“Are you going somewhere?” said Harry.
“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself
from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up.
“Urgent call — unavoidable — got to go —”
“What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily.

“Well, as to that — most unfortunate —” said Lockhart, avoid-
ing their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying

the contents into a bag. “No one regrets more than I —”
“You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!” said Harry.
“You can’t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!”

“Well — I must say — when I took the job —” Lockhart mut-
tered, now piling socks on top of his robes. “nothing in the job de-
scription — didn’t expect —”

“You mean you’re running away? said Harry disbelievingly. “Af-
ter all that stuff you did in your books —”

“Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart delicately.
“You wrote them!” Harry shouted.
“My dear boy,” said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at
Harry. “Do use your common sense. My books wouldn’t have sold
half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things. No one
wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he
did save a village from werewolves. He’d look dreadful on the front

cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Ban-
don Banshee had a hairy chin. I mean, come on —”

“So you’ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people
have done?” said Harry incredulously.
“Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently,
“it’s not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 298 

to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed
to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on
them so they wouldn’t remember doing it. If there’s one thing I
pride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms. No, it’s been a lot of
work, Harry. It’s not all book signings and publicity photos, you
know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard
slog.”
He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.
“Let’s see,” he said. “I think that’s everything. Yes. Only one
thing left.”
He pulled out his wand and turned to them.
“Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory Charm on
you now. Can’t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. I’d
never sell another book —”
Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised
his, when Harry bellowed, “Expelliarmus!”
Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand
flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open
window.
“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,” said

Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside. Lockhart was look-
ing up at him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand

at him.
“What d’you want me to do?” said Lockhart weakly. “I don’t
know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There’s nothing I can do.”
“You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at
wandpoint. “We think we know where it is. And what’s inside it.
Let’s go.”

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 299 

They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest
stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the
wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was
shaking.
Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.
“Oh, it’s you,” she said when she saw Harry. “What do you want
this time?”
“To ask you how you died,” said Harry.
Myrtle’s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she
had never been asked such a flattering question.
“Ooooh, it was dreadful,” she said with relish. “It happened

right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I’d hid-
den because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The

door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody
come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think
it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy
speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own
toilet, and then —” Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining.
“I died.”
“How?” said Harry.
“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones. “I just remember seeing
a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up,
and then I was floating away. . . .” She looked dreamily at Harry.
“And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive
Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she’d ever laughed at my
glasses.”
“Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 300 

“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the
sink in front of her toilet.
Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well
back, a look of utter terror on his face.
It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it,
inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it:
Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.
“That tap’s never worked,” said Myrtle brightly as he tried to
turn it.
“Harry,” said Ron. “Say something. Something in Parseltongue.”

“But —” Harry thought hard. The only times he’d ever man-
aged to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been faced with a real

snake. He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it
was real.
“Open up,” he said.
He looked at Ron, who shook his head.
“English,” he said.
Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was
alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though
it were moving.
“Open up,” he said.
Except that the words weren’t what he heard; a strange hissing
had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white
light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the
sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a
pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.
Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his
mind what he was going to do.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 301 
“I’m going down there,” he said.
He couldn’t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the
Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest
chance that Ginny might be alive.
“Me too,” said Ron.
There was a pause.
“Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart, with a
shadow of his old smile. “I’ll just —”
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both
pointed their wands at him.
“You can go first,” Ron snarled.
White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.
“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will it do?”
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his
legs into the pipe.
“I really don’t think —” he started to say, but Ron gave him a
push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered
himself slowly into the pipe, then let go.
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could
see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as
theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and
he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the
dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the
curves.

And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would hap-
pen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out

of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark
stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 302 

feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry
stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.

“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his voice echo-
ing in the black tunnel.

“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting around at the
dark, slimy walls.
All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.
“Lumos!” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. “C’mon,”
he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps
slapping loudly on the wet floor.
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance
ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the
wandlight.

“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously for-
ward, “any sign of movement, close your eyes right away. . . .”

But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected
sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned
out to be a rat’s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor
and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very
hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her,
Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.
“Harry — there’s something up there —” said Ron hoarsely,
grabbing Harry’s shoulder.

They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of some-
thing huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn’t mov-
ing.

“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the other two.
Lockhart’s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to
look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 303 

Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still
see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high.
The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous
green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature
that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.
“Blimey,” said Ron weakly.

There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lock-
hart’s knees had given way.

“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.
Lockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron, knocking him
to the ground.

Harry jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was straighten-
ing up, panting, Ron’s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back

on his face.
“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take a bit of
this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the
girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her
mangled body — say good-bye to your memories!”
He raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,
“Obliviate!”
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung
his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin,

out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thunder-
ing to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a

solid wall of broken rock.
“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!”

“I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the rock-
fall. “I’m okay — this git’s not, though — he got blasted by the

wand —”

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

 304 

There was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as though
Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.
“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate. “We can’t
get through — it’ll take ages. . . .”

Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had ap-
peared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as

these rocks by magic, and now didn’t seem a good moment to
try — what if the whole tunnel caved in?
There was another thud and another “ow!” from behind the
rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the
Chamber of Secrets for hours. . . . Harry knew there was only one
thing to do.
“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll go
on. . . . If I’m not back in an hour . . .”
There was a very pregnant pause.
“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who seemed to
be trying to keep his voice steady. “So you can — can get back
through. And, Harry —”
“See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some confidence
into his shaking voice.
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was
gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry’s
body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet
dreaded what he’d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept
around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two
entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting
emeralds.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS

 305 

Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to
pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely
alive.
He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the
emerald eyes seemed to flicker.
“Open,” said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.
The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid
smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot,
walked inside.

C H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N

 306 

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit cham-
ber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved

serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long,
black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.

His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill si-
lence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a

pillar? And where was Ginny?

He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the ser-
pentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the

shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them
shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of
the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with
a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.
Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as
the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.
H

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 307 

Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above:

It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell al-
most to the bottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes, where

two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And
between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with
flaming-red hair.
“Ginny!” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his
knees. “Ginny — don’t be dead — please don’t be dead —” He
flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny’s shoulders, and turned her
over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were
closed, so she wasn’t Petrified. But then she must be —
“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately, shaking
her. Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.
“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.
Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.
A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,
watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though
Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there
was no mistaking him —
“Tom — Tom Riddle?”
Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face.
“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said desperately.
“She’s not — she’s not — ?”
“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.”
Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty
years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him,
not a day older than sixteen.
“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 308 

“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary for fifty
years.”
He pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying
open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning
Myrtle’s bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got
there — but there were more pressing matters to deal with.
“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising Ginny’s head
again. “We’ve got to get her out of here. There’s a basilisk . . . I
don’t know where it is, but it could be along any moment. . . .
Please, help me —”
Riddle didn’t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny
half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.
But his wand had gone.
“Did you see — ?”
He looked up. Riddle was still watching him — twirling Harry’s
wand between his long fingers.
“Thanks,” said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.
A smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He continued to
stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.
“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny’s
dead weight. “We’ve got to go! If the basilisk comes —”
“It won’t come until it is called,” said Riddle calmly.
Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up
any longer.
“What d’you mean?” he said. “Look, give me my wand, I might
need it —”
Riddle’s smile broadened.
“You won’t be needing it,” he said.

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 309 

Harry stared at him.
“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?”
“I’ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,” said Riddle. “For
the chance to see you. To speak to you.”
“Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you get it.
We’re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later —”
“We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and
he pocketed Harry’s wand.
Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on
here. . . .
“How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly.
“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle pleasantly.
“And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley’s
like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets
to an invisible stranger.”
“What are you talking about?” said Harry.
“The diary,” said Riddle. “My diary. Little Ginny’s been writing
in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and
woes — how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school
with secondhand robes and books, how” — Riddle’s eyes glinted —
“how she didn’t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever
like her. . . .”
All the time he spoke, Riddle’s eyes never left Harry’s face. There
was an almost hungry look in them.
“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an
eleven-year-old girl,” he went on. “But I was patient. I wrote back.
I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one’s ever
understood me like you, Tom. . . . I’m so glad I’ve got this diary to

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 310 

confide in. . . . It’s like having a friend I can carry around in my
pocket. . . .”
Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn’t suit him. It made
the hairs stand up on the back of Harry’s neck.
“If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to charm the
people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul
happened to be exactly what I wanted. . . . I grew stronger and
stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew
powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful
enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start
pouring a little of my soul back into her . . .”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry, whose mouth had gone very
dry.
“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle softly.
“Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the
school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She
set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib’s
cat.”
“No,” Harry whispered.
“Yes,” said Riddle, calmly. “Of course, she didn’t know what she
was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen
her new diary entries . . . far more interesting, they became. . . .
Dear Tom,” he recited, watching Harry’s horrified face, “I think I’m
losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I
don’t know how they got there. Dear Tom, I can’t remember what I did
on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I’ve got paint
all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I’m pale and I’m
not myself. I think he suspects me. . . . There was another attack today

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 311 

and I don’t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think
I’m going mad. . . . I think I’m the one attacking everyone, Tom!”
Harry’s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his
palms.
“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting
her diary,” said Riddle. “But she finally became suspicious and
tried to dispose of it. And that’s where you came in, Harry. You
found it, and I couldn’t have been more delighted. Of all the people
who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most
anxious to meet. . . .”
“And why did you want to meet me?” said Harry. Anger was
coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.

“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,” said Rid-
dle. “Your whole fascinating history.” His eyes roved over the light-
ning scar on Harry’s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier.

“I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I
could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great
oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust —”
“Hagrid’s my friend,” said Harry, his voice now shaking. “And
you framed him, didn’t you? I thought you made a mistake,
but —”
Riddle laughed his high laugh again.
“It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you can imagine
how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom
Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect,
model student . . . on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in
trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his
bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls . . . but I

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 312 

admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought
someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be the Heir of
Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I

could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret en-
trance . . . as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!

“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to
think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid
and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have
guessed. . . . Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the
other teachers did. . . .”
“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said Harry, his teeth
gritted.
“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after
Hagrid was expelled,” said Riddle carelessly. “I knew it wouldn’t be
safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I
wasn’t going to waste those long years I’d spent searching for it. I
decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self

in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead an-
other in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.”

“Well, you haven’t finished it,” said Harry triumphantly. “No
one’s died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all
right again —”
“Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that killing
Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore? For many months now,
my new target has been — you.”
Harry stared at him.
“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 313 

opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you
with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out how
to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even

worse, I told you who’d been strangling roosters? So the foolish lit-
tle brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back.

But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the
trail of Slytherin’s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about
you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery —
particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny
had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak
Parseltongue. . . .
“So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come
down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring.
But there isn’t much life left in her. . . . She put too much into
the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last. . . . I
have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew
you’d come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.”
“Like what?” Harry spat, fists still clenched.
“Well,” said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, “how is it that you —
a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent — managed
to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape

with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were de-
stroyed?”

There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.

“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Volde-
mort was after your time. . . .”

“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future,
Harry Potter. . . .”

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 314 

He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it
through the air, writing three shimmering words:
tom marvolo riddle

Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name re-
arranged themselves:

i am lord voldemort

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at
Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I
was going to use my filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in
whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through
my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle,
who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found
out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a new
name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to
speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”

Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Rid-
dle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own

parents, and so many others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing
fast. “Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard
in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when
you were strong, you didn’t dare try and take over at Hogwarts.
Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still
frightens you now, wherever you’re hiding these days —”
The smile had gone from Riddle’s face, to be replaced by a very
ugly look.

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 315 

“Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere mem-
ory of me!” he hissed.

“He’s not as gone as you might think!” Harry retorted. He was
speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than
believing it to be true —
Riddle opened his mouth, but froze.
Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to
stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It
was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s
scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its
normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt
it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the
nearest pillar.
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird
music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long
as a peacock’s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a
ragged bundle.
A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped
the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on
his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw
it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.
The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry’s
cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.
“That’s a phoenix. . . .” said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.
“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s golden claws
squeeze his shoulder gently.
“And that —” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that
Fawkes had dropped, “that’s the old school Sorting Hat —”

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 316 

So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at
Harry’s feet.
Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark
Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at
once —
“This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an
old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?”
Harry didn’t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the
Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for
Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.
“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly.
“Twice — in your past, in my future — we have met. And twice I
failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The
longer you talk,” he added softly, “the longer you stay alive.”
Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the
wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which
would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right . . . but the
longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of
Ginny . . . and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s
outline was becoming clearer, more solid. . . . If it had to be a fight
between him and Riddle, better sooner than later.
“No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked
me,” said Harry abruptly. “I don’t know myself. But I know why

you couldn’t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My com-
mon Muggle-born mother,” he added, shaking with suppressed rage.

“She stopped you killing me. And I’ve seen the real you, I saw you
last year. You’re a wreck. You’re barely alive. That’s where all your
power got you. You’re in hiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul —”

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 317 

Riddle’s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile.

“So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that’s a powerful counter-
charm. I can see now . . . there is nothing special about you, after

all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us,
after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans,
raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to
Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something
alike . . . but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you
from me. That’s all I wanted to know.”

Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Rid-
dle’s twisted smile was widening again.

“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson. Let’s match

the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against fa-
mous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give

him. . . .”
He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then

walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Rid-
dle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of

Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his

mouth wide and hissed — but Harry understood what he was say-
ing. . . .

“Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.”
Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying
on his shoulder.
Slytherin’s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry
saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.
And something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth. Something
was slithering up from its depths.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 318 

Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he
shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes’ wing sweep his cheek as he took
flight. Harry wanted to shout, “Don’t leave me!” but what chance
did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it
shudder — he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could
almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth.
Then he heard Riddle’s hissing voice:
“Kill him.”
The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy
body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut,

Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feel-
ing his way — Voldemort was laughing —

Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood —
the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming —
There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and
then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into
the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more
mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars —
He couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough to squint
at what was going on.
The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak
trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was
weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to
close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.
Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping
furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers —
Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 319 

sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake’s tail
thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his
eyes, it turned — Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its
eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the
phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting
in agony.
“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming. “LEAVE THE BIRD!
LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! YOU CAN
STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!”
The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was
circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its
scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.

“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone — any-
one —”

The snake’s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked.
Something soft hit his face.
The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry’s arms. Harry
seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance — he rammed it onto
his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail
swung over him again.

Help me — help me — Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight un-
der the hat. Please help me —

There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as
though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry’s
head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he
grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and
hard beneath it.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 320 

A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle
glittering with rubies the size of eggs.
“KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND
YOU! SNIFF — SMELL HIM!”
Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk’s head was falling, its
body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He
could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide,
wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his
sword, thin, glittering, venomous —
It lunged blindly — Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It
lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry’s side. He raised
the sword in both his hands —
The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true — Harry
threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into
the roof of the serpent’s mouth —
But as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a searing pain
just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper
and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over
sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.
Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading
poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he
knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and
steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched

his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Cham-
ber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.

A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of
claws beside him.
“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic, Fawkes. . . .”

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent’s
fang had pierced him.
He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved
in front of him.
“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above him. “Dead.

Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Pot-
ter? He’s crying.”

Harry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus. Thick,
pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.
“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your
time. I’m in no hurry.”
Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.
“So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s distant voice.
“Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated
at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You’ll be back
with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. . . . She bought you
twelve years of borrowed time . . . but Lord Voldemort got you in
the end, as you knew he must. . . .”
If this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad.
Even the pain was leaving him. . . .
But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed
to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and
there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly
patch of tears was shining all around the wound — except that there
was no wound —
“Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly. “Get away from
him — I said, get away —”
Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry’s wand at

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 322 

Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in
a whirl of gold and scarlet.
“Phoenix tears . . .” said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry’s arm.
“Of course . . . healing powers . . . I forgot . . .”
He looked into Harry’s face. “But it makes no difference. In fact,
I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter . . . you and
me. . . .”
He raised the wand —
Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and
something fell into Harry’s lap — the diary.
For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared
at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had
meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor
next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.
There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of
the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry’s hands, flooding the
floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and
then —
He had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and
there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still
oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling
hole right through it.
Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning

as though he’d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gath-
ered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug,

retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s mouth.
Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny
was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 323 

eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in
his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a
great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.
“Harry — oh, Harry — I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I
c-couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it was me, Harry — but I — I
s-swear I d-didn’t mean to — R-Riddle made me, he t-took me
over — and — how did you kill that — that thing? W-where’s
Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the
diary —”
“It’s all right,” said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing
Ginny the fang hole, “Riddle’s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk.
C’mon, Ginny, let’s get out of here —”

“I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped her awk-
wardly to her feet. “I’ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever

since B-Bill came and n-now I’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll
Mum and Dad say?”
Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.
Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils
of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the
tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft
hiss.
After a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound
of slowly shifting rock reached Harry’s ears.
“Ron!” Harry yelled, speeding up. “Ginny’s okay! I’ve got her!”
He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next
bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had
managed to make in the rockfall.
“Ginny!” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 324 

her through first. “You’re alive! I don’t believe it! What happened?
How — what — where did that bird come from?”
Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.
“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through himself.

“How come you’ve got a sword?” said Ron, gaping at the glitter-
ing weapon in Harry’s hand.

“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said Harry with a sideways
glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.
“But —”
“Later,” Harry said shortly. He didn’t think it was a good idea to
tell Ron yet who’d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny,
anyway. “Where’s Lockhart?”
“Back there,” said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head
up the tunnel toward the pipe. “He’s in a bad way. Come and see.”
Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden
glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of
the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to
himself.
“His memory’s gone,” said Ron. “The Memory Charm backfired.
Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or

who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He’s a danger to him-
self.”

Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.
“Hello,” he said. “Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do you live here?”
“No,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.
Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.
“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” he said
to Ron.

THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN

 325 

Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past
Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright
in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry
looked uncertainly at him.

“He looks like he wants you to grab hold . . .” said Ron, look-
ing perplexed. “But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up

there —”
“Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He turned quickly
to the others. “We’ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron’s
hand. Professor Lockhart —”
“He means you,” said Ron sharply to Lockhart.
“You hold Ginny’s other hand —”
Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron
took hold of the back of Harry’s robes, and Harry reached out and
took hold of Fawkes’s strangely hot tail feathers.
An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole
body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying
upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling
below him, saying, “Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!”
The chill air was whipping through Harry’s hair, and before he’d

stopped enjoying the ride, it was over — all four of them were hit-
ting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, and as Lockhart

straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into
place.
Myrtle goggled at them.
“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry.

“There’s no need to sound so disappointed,” he said grimly, wip-
ing flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

 326 

“Oh, well . . . I’d just been thinking . . . if you had died, you’d
have been welcome to share my toilet,” said Myrtle, blushing silver.
“Urgh!” said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted
corridor outside. “Harry! I think Myrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve
got competition, Ginny!”
But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s face.
“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry
pointed.
Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor.
They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside
Professor McGonagall’s office.
Harry knocked and pushed the door open.

DOBBY’S REWARD

or a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and
Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime
and (in Harry’s case) blood. Then there was a scream.
“Ginny!”
It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the
fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both
of them flung themselves on their daughter.
Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore

was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor Mc-
Gonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her

chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled on
Dumbledore’s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being
swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight embrace.
“You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?”
“I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor McGonagall
weakly.
F

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

 328 

Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then

walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-
encrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle’s diary.

Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of
an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing
the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he
was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed
the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last
victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning
Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber
of Secrets might be in her bathroom. . . .
“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused,
“so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred
school rules into pieces along the way, I might add — but how on
earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?”
So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking,
told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat
giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided
mentioning Riddle’s diary — or Ginny. She was standing with her
head against Mrs. Weasley’s shoulder, and tears were still coursing
silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought
in panic. Riddle’s diary didn’t work anymore. . . . How could they
prove it had been he who’d made her do it all?
Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly,
the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.
“What interests me most,” said Dumbledore gently, “is how
Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell
me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.”

DOBBY’S REWARD

 329 

Relief — warm, sweeping, glorious relief — swept over Harry.

“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. “You-
Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny’s not . . . Ginny hasn’t

been . . . has she?”

“It was this diary,” said Harry quickly, picking it up and show-
ing it to Dumbledore. “Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen. . . .”

Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down
his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.
“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably the most
brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the
Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.
“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called
Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He
disappeared after leaving the school . . . traveled far and wide . . .
sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of
our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations,

that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recog-
nizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever,

handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.”
“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What’s our Ginny got to do
with — with — him?”
“His d-diary!” Ginny sobbed. “I’ve b-been writing in it, and he’s
been w-writing back all year —”
“Ginny!” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I taught you
anything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that
can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t
you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like
that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic —”

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

 330 

“I d-didn’t know,” sobbed Ginny. “I found it inside one of the
books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there
and forgotten about it —”
“Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,”
Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. “This has been a terrible

ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wiz-
ards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.” He

strode over to the door and opened it. “Bed rest and perhaps a large,
steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,”
he added, twinkling kindly down at her. “You will find that Madam
Pomfrey is still awake. She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I
daresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any moment.”
“So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly.

“There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,” said Dumble-
dore.

Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still
looking deeply shaken.
“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully
to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this merits a good feast.
Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?”
“Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the
door. “I’ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?”
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.
She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore.
What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them?
Surely — surely — they weren’t about to be punished?
“I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel
you if you broke any more school rules,” said Dumbledore.

DOBBY’S REWARD

 331 
Ron opened his mouth in horror.
“Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our

words,” Dumbledore went on, smiling. “You will both receive Spe-
cial Awards for Services to the School and — let me see — yes, I

think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.”
Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine flowers and
closed his mouth again.
“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part

in this dangerous adventure,” Dumbledore added. “Why so mod-
est, Gilderoy?”

Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart.
He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the
room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed
him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking
to.
“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was an
accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart —”
“Am I a professor?” said Lockhart in mild surprise. “Goodness. I
expect I was hopeless, was I?”
“He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,” Ron
explained quietly to Dumbledore.
“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver
mustache quivering. “Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!”
“Sword?” said Lockhart dimly. “Haven’t got a sword. That boy
has, though.” He pointed at Harry. “He’ll lend you one.”

“Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infir-
mary, too?” Dumbledore said to Ron. “I’d like a few more words

with Harry. . . .”

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

 332 

Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumble-
dore and Harry as he closed the door.

Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.
“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably
nervous.
“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said Dumbledore, eyes
twinkling again. “You must have shown me real loyalty down in
the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.”
He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his
knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.
“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore thoughtfully.
“I imagine he was most interested in you. . . .”
Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling
out of his mouth.
“Professor Dumbledore . . . Riddle said I’m like him. Strange
likenesses, he said. . . .”
“Did he, now?” said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry
from under his thick silver eyebrows. “And what do you think,
Harry?”
“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly than he’d
intended. “I mean, I’m — I’m in Gryffindor, I’m . . .”
But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.
“Professor,” he started again after a moment. “The Sorting Hat
told me I’d — I’d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I

was Slytherin’s heir for a while . . . because I can speak Parsel-
tongue. . . .”

“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly,
“because Lord Voldemort — who is the last remaining descendant

DOBBY’S REWARD

 333 

of Salazar Slytherin — can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much
mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night
he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I’m
sure. . . .”

“Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunder-
struck.

“It certainly seems so.”
“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately
into Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s
power in me, and it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to
me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin

prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parsel-
tongue — resourcefulness — determination — a certain disregard

for rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting
Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice,
“because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes
you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that

show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” Harry sat mo-
tionless in his chair, stunned. “If you want proof, Harry, that you

belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.”
Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall’s desk,
picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry.
Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And
then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.
Godric Gryffindor.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

 334 

“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat,
Harry,” said Dumbledore simply.
For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled
open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall’s desk and took
out a quill and a bottle of ink.
“What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go

down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban — we need our game-
keeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily

Prophet, too,” he added thoughtfully. “We’ll be needing a new De-
fense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . Dear me, we do seem to

run through them, don’t we?”
Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for
the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it
bounced back off the wall.

Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering be-
hind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.

“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the
room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of
his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face.
The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting
to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy’s shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had
set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished,
but his usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing

apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dum-
bledore.

“So!” he said “You’ve come back. The governors suspended you,
but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.”

DOBBY’S REWARD

 335 

“Well, you see, Lucius,” said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, “the
other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like
being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard
that Arthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and wanted me
back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the
job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too. . . . Several of

them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their fami-
lies if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.”

Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still
slits of fury.
“So — have you stopped the attacks yet?” he sneered. “Have you
caught the culprit?”
“We have,” said Dumbledore, with a smile.
“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply. “Who is it?”
“The same person as last time, Lucius,” said Dumbledore. “But
this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By
means of this diary.”
He held up the small black book with the large hole through the
center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching
Dobby.
The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed
meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr.
Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.
“I see . . .” said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.
“A clever plan,” said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring
Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. “Because if Harry here” — Mr.
Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look — “and his friend Ron hadn’t
discovered this book, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

 336 

the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn’t
acted of her own free will. . . .”
Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.

“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might have hap-
pened then. . . . The Weasleys are one of our most prominent

pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his

Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attack-
ing and killing Muggle-borns. . . . Very fortunate the diary was dis-
covered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it. Who knows what

the consequences might have been otherwise. . . .”
Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.
“Very fortunate,” he said stiffly.

And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the di-
ary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.

And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and
Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.
“Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr.
Malfoy?” said Harry.
Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.
“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?” he
said.
“Because you gave it to her,” said Harry. “In Flourish and Blotts.
You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary
inside it, didn’t you?”
He saw Mr. Malfoy’s white hands clench and unclench.
“Prove it,” he hissed.
“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore, smiling
at Harry. “Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On

 337 

the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out
any more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things. If any more of
them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley,
for one, will make sure they are traced back to you. . . .”
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his
right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand.
Instead, he turned to his house-elf.
“We’re going, Dobby!”
He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to
him, he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby
squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for
a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him —

“Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly. “Can I give that di-
ary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?”

“Certainly, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But hurry. The
feast, remember. . . .”
Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could
hear Dobby’s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly,
wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of
his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into
it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.
He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.
“Mr. Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got something
for you —”
And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s hand.
“What the — ?”
Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then
looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

 338 

“You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these
days, Harry Potter,” he said softly. “They were meddlesome fools,
too.”
He turned to go.
“Come, Dobby. I said, come.”
But Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Harry’s disgusting,
slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.
“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment. “Master
gave it to Dobby.”
“What’s that?” spat Mr. Malfoy. “What did you say?”
“Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it, and
Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.”
Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at
Harry.
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”
But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward.
He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled
heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out
his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.

“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Mal-
foy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the
pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of
sight.
“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at
Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like
eyes. “Harry Potter set Dobby free!”

DOBBY’S REWARD

 339 

“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just promise
never to try and save my life again.”
The elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy
smile.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said Harry as Dobby pulled
on Harry’s sock with shaking hands. “You told me all this had
nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember?
Well —”
“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this
was obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he
changed his name, could be freely named, you see?”
“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s a feast,
and my friend Hermione should be awake by now. . . .”
Dobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and hugged him.
“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he sobbed.
“Farewell, Harry Potter!”
And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.
Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like
this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all

night. Harry didn’t know whether the best bit was Hermione run-
ning toward him, screaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or Justin

hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and
apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at
half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders
that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron’s
four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for
the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to

tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat

(“Oh, no!” said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, un-
fortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next

year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his mem-
ory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that

greeted this news.
“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. “He was
starting to grow on me.”
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences —
Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had
plenty of practice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled

Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school gover-
nor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he

owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky.
On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.

Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Ex-
press. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a com-
partment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours

in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They
played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George’s
Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic.
Harry was getting very good at it.
They were almost at King’s Cross when Harry remembered
something.
“Ginny — what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t want
you to tell anyone?”

“Oh, that,” said Ginny, giggling. “Well — Percy’s got a girlfriend.”
Fred dropped a stack of books on George’s head.
“What?”
“It’s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,” said Ginny.
“That’s who he was writing to all last summer. He’s been meeting
her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an
empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was — you

know — attacked. You won’t tease him, will you?” she added anx-
iously.

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred, who was looking like his
birthday had come early.
“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering.
The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.
Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to
Ron and Hermione.
“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron, scribbling it
twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. “I
told your dad how to use a telephone last summer — he’ll know.
Call me at the Dursleys’, okay? I can’t stand another two months
with only Dudley to talk to. . . .”
“Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won’t they?” said
Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging
toward the enchanted barrier. “When they hear what you did this
year?
“Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I could’ve
died, and I didn’t manage it? They’ll be furious. . . .”
And together they walked back through the gateway to the
Muggle world.
