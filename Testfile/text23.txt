CHAPTER I. The Basics of Corruption
1. Some concepts of corruption
1.1. What is corruption?
Corruption is the illegal act of abusing positions and powers to enjoy material benefits, causing damage to property of the State, collectives and individuals, and infringing upon the proper operation of agencies and organizations. .
1.2. What is a crime of corruption?
In the 2015 Penal Code, there is no concept of corruption crimes but the concept of position crimes in general, which divides into two main groups of crimes: corrupt criminals and group of crimes about position. The 2015 Penal Code still maintains 7 criminalized acts of corruption, including: Property embezzlement; Bribery; Abuse of positions and powers to appropriate property; Abusing positions and powers while performing official duties; Abuse of power while performing official duties; Abusing positions and powers to influence others for personal gain; Fraud at work.
From the generalization of legal signs related to corruption crimes, it can be understood: “Corruption crimes are acts that are dangerous to society, specified in the Penal Code, infringing on proper and equitable activities. often by agencies or organizations, infringing upon the interests of the State, organizations and citizens, performed by persons with positions and powers while performing their official duties or tasks for the purpose of self-seeking.
2. Characteristic elements of corrupt behavior
2.1. The subject of corruption is a person with a position and authority
The characteristic of corruption is that the subject of the act must be a person with a position and authority. Persons with positions and powers include: cadres, civil servants and public employees;officers, professional soldiers, defense workers in agencies and units of the People's Army; officers, professional non-commissioned officers, officers, professional and technical non-commissioned officers in agencies and units of the People's Public Security; leaders and managers in State-owned enterprises; leading cadres and managers who are representatives of the State's capital contribution in enterprises; persons assigned to perform tasks or official duties have powers while performing such tasks or official duties (Clause 3, Article 1, 2005 Law on Anti-corruption).
This target group has specific characteristics compared to other target groups such as: they are usually people with a working and devoted history, so they have a lot of experience; systematically trained, are experts in many different fields; are those who have wide connections and certain social prestige and even economic strengths. These characteristics of the subject of corrupt acts are the factors that make it difficult to detect, investigate and adjudicate corrupt acts.
2.2. Corruption subjects take advantage of their assigned positions and powers
 "Abusing positions and powers" for personal gain is the second characteristic of corruption. When committing corrupt acts, corrupt persons must use their "positions and powers" as a means to benefit themselves, their families or others. This is the basic element to identify corrupt behavior. A person who has a position and power but does not abuse that position or power does not commit corrupt acts. However, not all acts of persons with positions and powers who have taken advantage of such positions and powers are considered corrupt acts. Here, there is an intersection between this behavior and other criminal acts, so it is important to pay attention when distinguishing corrupt acts from other illegal acts.
2.3. The purpose of corruption is self-seeking
 Corruption is intentional. The purpose of corrupt acts is self-seeking. If the subject commits an act unintentionally, it is not an act of corruption. Self-interest here is understood as a material benefit or a spiritual benefit that a person with a position or power has achieved or can achieve through corrupt acts. Thus, when dealing with corrupt acts, it is not obligatory for corrupt subjects to gain benefits.
3. Causes of corruption
Firstly, the system of policies and legal documents is complicated, lack of rigor and synchronization.
Article 12 of the 1992 Constitution stipulates: "The State manages society by law and constantly strengthens the socialist legislation"[6]. In order to strengthen the socialist legislation, in recent years, our state's legislative technique has developed significantly. The legal system was strong enough to cover all social relations, especially important and basic social relations... However, the number of legal documents promulgated increased, but the legal system did not. weak. Because, the legal documents in the legal system in Vietnam, when placed side by side, overlap and exclude each other. In Vietnam, a land of the people now has at least 3 regulatory documents: land law, civil law, administrative law... These legal documents have different adjustment methods, contradict each other. When applying, state agencies often use legal documents that are most beneficial to them and that is also one of the reasons leading to corruption.
The complexity, lack of rigor and synchronism of the policy and legal system leads to arbitrary application. At the same time, the frequent amendment, supplement, and change of documents and policies makes people, especially businesses, unable to update and grasp their rights and obligations in time.
In addition, when the law is not consistently applied and enforced, for example, the same requirement but the process of applying the law from the state management agency gives different results, Citizens or businesses may have to consider the solution of paying unofficial costs to the authorized person. This creates opportunities for arbitrary and corrupt acts for the benefit of those with positions and powers during the performance of their official duties. While people or businesses are willing to pay an unofficial fee in transactions with state agencies in order to be resolved more quickly the procedures.
Secondly, there is a lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units.
In an operating environment lacking publicity and transparency, when people with positions and powers are not pressured from thinking that all acts can be monitored by other entities, or that if actions are Whether detected is also difficult to assess due to lack of information or lack of clarity in publicly available information, they often tend to abuse their assigned power for self-seeking purposes. Therefore, the lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units is one of the reasons for creating favorable conditions for the implementation of corrupt acts.
Third, lack of a healthy competitive environment for activitiesbusiness action.
In a business environment where there is still a monopoly in the provision of services and goods, businesses, instead of improving their competitiveness in a healthy way, will seek to develop relationships with state agencies, state agencies, and other organizations. Business Partners. They are willing to pay unofficial costs to win big contracts or win tender packages to supply goods and equipment, especially in public procurement. The incompleteness of the legal provisions on bidding, the lack of mechanisms to control conflicts of interest, etc. are all conditions that promote the risk of committing corrupt acts.
Fourth, the remuneration regime is not satisfactory for the contingent of cadres, civil servants, public employees and employees in agencies, organizations, units and enterprises.
Vietnam belongs to the group of countries with a relatively complicated social transition. Traditional Confucian norms began to fade away as Vietnam came into contact with Western civilization through French colonialism. The newly established regime simulates Soviet social institutions with features such as dictatorship of the proletariat, collective mastery, centralized planning mechanism... After the VI Congress, the economy was switched to The market mechanism entails a series of other important changes in social structure and norms. Vietnam's modernization took place at the same time as globalization in the world, making Vietnam never before facing such rich and complex social changes as it is today. One limitation of Vietnam's social transition is that most of it takes place in passive circumstances. This makes the state of "disorder in social norms" during the transition in Vietnam even more severe when there is a complete lack of forecasts and coping plans. For example, the issue of salaries of civil servants. The difference in wages and remuneration in general between the state and non-state sectors, among enterprises themselves, gives rise to corruption motives of cadres, civil servants and public employees in various sectors. conflict of interest situations. The official salary and material benefits obtained from work are not enough to meet the living needs of themselves and their families, they will find ways to commit illegal acts for personal gain by the government. duties and powers created by them. The market mechanism has different standards of fairness, so it does not accept such income equality. And there is indeed a double standard in Vietnamese society on this issue, when in nominal terms the income between executive and leading civil servants is not much different, but in reality, the gap is quite large. very big. In summary, Vietnam is a typical model to study about the state of “normative disorder” in society; and this is also an important cause of corruption.

4. Harms and effects of corruption
4.1. About politics
Currently, corruption in our country has reached an extremely serious level, leading to many serious consequences. Corruption occurs not only at the central level, in major programs and projects, but also at the grassroots levels of government, which are in contact with the people on a daily basis.

The harmful effects of waste are a large amount of property of the State, the collective and each citizen.
4.3. About society
For the social aspect, the consequences of corruption are to change and upset social ethical standards, alienating the contingent of state officials and civil servants.
Before the illicit benefits obtained from performing corrupt acts; Many people with positions and interests have not kept their moral qualities. The assigned positions and powers are no longer used to serve the people, but are directed towards nefarious interests, despite violating the law, violating official duties, and immoral.
Corruption does not only occur in fields such as economics, finance, banking, etc. Which is gradually tending to spread to other fields - the fields ofIn areas where corruption is less likely to occur, such as culture, health, education, etc., it even spreads to areas that are considered impossible to have corrupt practices from a legal and ethical perspective such as social welfare or legal protection. The more so, the more serious and harmful the consequences of corruption in Vietnam will be.

Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great impacts on the social life of
Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as
in advance, leading to the fear of no job opportunities and unemployment.
Although the epidemic has caused difficulties for students, it is important
It is important that students stay calm, confident and step by step find a solution. Pandemic
Disease is also an opportunity for students to develop themselves, contribute to the community and
improve flexibility, adapt to actual conditions. That's why our group
decided to choose the topic: "Covid-19 affects the life of Vietnamese students" to do
The essay thereby will clarify the difficulties and challenges, the level of influence of the
epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.
The Covid 19 epidemic is an acute infectious respiratory disease that causes
caused by the coronavirus SARS COV-2 and its variants.
This disease first appeared in 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province
North, China. The causative agent is confirmed to be a new strain of corona virus.
The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans, and has been shown to spread from person to person
people, usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs or sneezes. Patient
symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus mainly affects
to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.
The outbreak of Covid-19 in Vietnam has had a great impact on learning as well
like the social life of Vietnamese students, especially students studying at
Universities in Ho Chi Minh City – where the epidemic is still taking place at present
stress.
First of all, on the issue of learning, due to the complicated epidemic situation, a series of
Universities move to online learning causing students to plan to gradually do
get used to this "new normal". Online learning has many advantages even in the current situation, but it also has many limitations. Online learning reduced
30% of the student's ability to absorb, and at the same time there are problems with the site
equipment as well as unstable Internet condition.2 Online learning requires students
must be proactive. One of the biggest concerns about this format is the lack of
interaction between faculty and students. For some practice modules, study is required
studying at a university, during the epidemic situation, it is not possible to conduct teaching
has a significant effect on the professional qualifications as well as the time to graduate from school.
Regarding social life, during the epidemic situation, most students returned to their hometowns,
but there are also a large number of students still in the epidemic area. Difficult economic conditions
difficult, the need for accommodation is a huge problem for students in this situation
the epidemic could not work part-time to cover life. Not only that, the activities
Clubs and social work have all stopped because of the impact of the epidemic
not insignificant to the training of skills and social knowledge in the university environment.
According to WorldOMeters, the website compiles demographic, economic, social and human indicators
people worldwide. As of 21:11, November 8, 2021, there are more than 250 . in the world
million cases and more than 5 million deaths in 230 countries and territories.

With such a large number of COVID-19 infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) is
The same concerns about the sequelae left by the virus. WHO urges patients who have
After being treated for COVID-19 and being affected by the sequelae left by the disease,
should seek medical help. Because until now the sequelae are still a pain
The pain of the pandemic has not yet found the best solution.
To date, very few people understand why some patients, after experiencing
through the acute phase, still suffers from symptoms such as shortness of breath, extreme

Chapter II: The current state of corruption in Vietnam

Chapter III: Anti-corruption solutions

Chapter V: Roles and responsibilities of society in anti-corruption
CHAPTER I. The Basics of Corruption
1. Some concepts of corruption
1.1. What is corruption?
Corruption is the illegal act of abusing positions and powers to enjoy material benefits, causing damage to property of the State, collectives and individuals, and infringing upon the proper operation of agencies and organizations. .
1.2. What is a crime of corruption?
In the 2015 Penal Code, there is no concept of corruption crimes but the concept of position crimes in general, which divides into two main groups of crimes: corrupt criminals and group of crimes about position. The 2015 Penal Code still maintains 7 criminalized acts of corruption, including: Property embezzlement; Bribery; Abuse of positions and powers to appropriate property; Abusing positions and powers while performing official duties; Abuse of power while performing official duties; Abusing positions and powers to influence others for personal gain; Fraud at work.
From the generalization of legal signs related to corruption crimes, it can be understood: “Corruption crimes are acts that are dangerous to society, specified in the Penal Code, infringing on proper and equitable activities. often by agencies or organizations, infringing upon the interests of the State, organizations and citizens, performed by persons with positions and powers while performing their official duties or tasks for the purpose of self-seeking.
2. Characteristic elements of corrupt behavior
2.1. The subject of corruption is a person with a position and authority
The characteristic of corruption is that the subject of the act must be a person with a position and authority. Persons with positions and powers include: cadres, civil servants and public employees;officers, professional soldiers, defense workers in agencies and units of the People's Army; officers, professional non-commissioned officers, officers, professional and technical non-commissioned officers in agencies and units of the People's Public Security; leaders and managers in State-owned enterprises; leading cadres and managers who are representatives of the State's capital contribution in enterprises; persons assigned to perform tasks or official duties have powers while performing such tasks or official duties (Clause 3, Article 1, 2005 Law on Anti-corruption).
This target group has specific characteristics compared to other target groups such as: they are usually people with a working and devoted history, so they have a lot of experience; systematically trained, are experts in many different fields; are those who have wide connections and certain social prestige and even economic strengths. These characteristics of the subject of corrupt acts are the factors that make it difficult to detect, investigate and adjudicate corrupt acts.
2.2. Corruption subjects take advantage of their assigned positions and powers
 "Abusing positions and powers" for personal gain is the second characteristic of corruption. When committing corrupt acts, corrupt persons must use their "positions and powers" as a means to benefit themselves, their families or others. This is the basic element to identify corrupt behavior. A person who has a position and power but does not abuse that position or power does not commit corrupt acts. However, not all acts of persons with positions and powers who have taken advantage of such positions and powers are considered corrupt acts. Here, there is an intersection between this behavior and other criminal acts, so it is important to pay attention when distinguishing corrupt acts from other illegal acts.
2.3. The purpose of corruption is self-seeking
 Corruption is intentional. The purpose of corrupt acts is self-seeking. If the subject commits an act unintentionally, it is not an act of corruption. Self-interest here is understood as a material benefit or a spiritual benefit that a person with a position or power has achieved or can achieve through corrupt acts. Thus, when dealing with corrupt acts, it is not obligatory for corrupt subjects to gain benefits.
3. Causes of corruption
Firstly, the system of policies and legal documents is complicated, lack of rigor and synchronization.
Article 12 of the 1992 Constitution stipulates: "The State manages society by law and constantly strengthens the socialist legislation"[6]. In order to strengthen the socialist legislation, in recent years, our state's legislative technique has developed significantly. The legal system was strong enough to cover all social relations, especially important and basic social relations... However, the number of legal documents promulgated increased, but the legal system did not. weak. Because, the legal documents in the legal system in Vietnam, when placed side by side, overlap and exclude each other. In Vietnam, a land of the people now has at least 3 regulatory documents: land law, civil law, administrative law... These legal documents have different adjustment methods, contradict each other. When applying, state agencies often use legal documents that are most beneficial to them and that is also one of the reasons leading to corruption.
The complexity, lack of rigor and synchronism of the policy and legal system leads to arbitrary application. At the same time, the frequent amendment, supplement, and change of documents and policies makes people, especially businesses, unable to update and grasp their rights and obligations in time.
In addition, when the law is not consistently applied and enforced, for example, the same requirement but the process of applying the law from the state management agency gives different results, Citizens or businesses may have to consider the solution of paying unofficial costs to the authorized person. This creates opportunities for arbitrary and corrupt acts for the benefit of those with positions and powers during the performance of their official duties. While people or businesses are willing to pay an unofficial fee in transactions with state agencies in order to be resolved more quickly the procedures.
Secondly, there is a lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units.
In an operating environment lacking publicity and transparency, when people with positions and powers are not pressured from thinking that all acts can be monitored by other entities, or that if actions are Whether detected is also difficult to assess due to lack of information or lack of clarity in publicly available information, they often tend to abuse their assigned power for self-seeking purposes. Therefore, the lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units is one of the reasons for creating favorable conditions for the implementation of corrupt acts.
Third, lack of a healthy competitive environment for activitiesbusiness action.
In a business environment where there is still a monopoly in the provision of services and goods, businesses, instead of improving their competitiveness in a healthy way, will seek to develop relationships with state agencies, state agencies, and other organizations. Business Partners. They are willing to pay unofficial costs to win big contracts or win tender packages to supply goods and equipment, especially in public procurement. The incompleteness of the legal provisions on bidding, the lack of mechanisms to control conflicts of interest, etc. are all conditions that promote the risk of committing corrupt acts.
Fourth, the remuneration regime is not satisfactory for the contingent of cadres, civil servants, public employees and employees in agencies, organizations, units and enterprises.
Vietnam belongs to the group of countries with a relatively complicated social transition. Traditional Confucian norms began to fade away as Vietnam came into contact with Western civilization through French colonialism. The newly established regime simulates Soviet social institutions with features such as dictatorship of the proletariat, collective mastery, centralized planning mechanism... After the VI Congress, the economy was switched to The market mechanism entails a series of other important changes in social structure and norms. Vietnam's modernization took place at the same time as globalization in the world, making Vietnam never before facing such rich and complex social changes as it is today. One limitation of Vietnam's social transition is that most of it takes place in passive circumstances. This makes the state of "disorder in social norms" during the transition in Vietnam even more severe when there is a complete lack of forecasts and coping plans. For example, the issue of salaries of civil servants. The difference in wages and remuneration in general between the state and non-state sectors, among enterprises themselves, gives rise to corruption motives of cadres, civil servants and public employees in various sectors. conflict of interest situations. The official salary and material benefits obtained from work are not enough to meet the living needs of themselves and their families, they will find ways to commit illegal acts for personal gain by the government. duties and powers created by them. The market mechanism has different standards of fairness, so it does not accept such income equality. And there is indeed a double standard in Vietnamese society on this issue, when in nominal terms the income between executive and leading civil servants is not much different, but in reality, the gap is quite large. very big. In summary, Vietnam is a typical model to study about the state of “normative disorder” in society; and this is also an important cause of corruption.

4. Harms and effects of corruption
4.1. About politics
Currently, corruption in our country has reached an extremely serious level, leading to many serious consequences. Corruption occurs not only at the central level, in major programs and projects, but also at the grassroots levels of government, which are in contact with the people on a daily basis.

The harmful effects of waste are a large amount of property of the State, the collective and each citizen.
4.3. About society
For the social aspect, the consequences of corruption are to change and upset social ethical standards, alienating the contingent of state officials and civil servants.
Before the illicit benefits obtained from performing corrupt acts; Many people with positions and interests have not kept their moral qualities. The assigned positions and powers are no longer used to serve the people, but are directed towards nefarious interests, despite violating the law, violating official duties, and immoral.
Corruption does not only occur in fields such as economics, finance, banking, etc. Which is gradually tending to spread to other fields - the fields ofIn areas where corruption is less likely to occur, such as culture, health, education, etc., it even spreads to areas that are considered impossible to have corrupt practices from a legal and ethical perspective such as social welfare or legal protection.

Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great impacts on the social life of
Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as
in advance, leading to the fear of no job opportunities and unemployment.
Although the epidemic has caused difficulties for students, it is important
It is important that students stay calm, confident and step by step find a solution. Pandemic
Disease is also an opportunity for students to develop themselves, contribute to the community and
improve flexibility, adapt to actual conditions. That's why our group
decided to choose the topic: "Covid-19 affects the life of Vietnamese students" to do
The essay thereby will clarify the difficulties and challenges, the level of influence of the
epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.
The Covid 19 epidemic is an acute infectious respiratory disease that causes
caused by the coronavirus SARS COV-2 and its variants.
This disease first appeared in 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province
North, China. The causative agent is confirmed to be a new strain of corona virus.
The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans, and has been shown to spread from person to person
people, usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs or sneezes. Patient
symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus mainly affects
to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.
The outbreak of Covid-19 in Vietnam has had a great impact on learning as well
like the social life of Vietnamese students, especially students studying at
Universities in Ho Chi Minh City – where the epidemic is still taking place at present
stress.
First of all, on the issue of learning, due to the complicated epidemic situation, a series of
Universities move to online learning causing students to plan to gradually do
get used to this "new normal". Online learning has many advantages even in the current situation, but it also has many limitations. Online learning reduced
30% of the student's ability to absorb, and at the same time there are problems with the site
equipment as well as unstable Internet condition.2 Online learning requires students
must be proactive. One of the biggest concerns about this format is the lack of
interaction between faculty and students. For some practice modules, study is required
studying at a university, during the epidemic situation, it is not possible to conduct teaching
has a significant effect on the professional qualifications as well as the time to graduate from school.
Regarding social life, during the epidemic situation, most students returned to their hometowns,
but there are also a large number of students still in the epidemic area. Difficult economic conditions
difficult, the need for accommodation is a huge problem for students in this situation

Ill - RESPONSIBILITIES OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PARTICIPANTS IN BUILDING THE TEAM OF TEAM OF TEAM OFFICERS, WITH SECURE
Defending the Fatherland of Vietnam, a literate society, is a sacred duty and a noble right of citizens, in which high school students have an important role. The Party's line, the State's laws and the legitimate aspirations of the youth can only be realized by practical actions, demonstrating the civic responsibility of students in the new era. So. In addition to actively studying and improving their cultural level, students need to study, understand and strictly comply with the State's laws, including the Military Law and the People's Public Security Law.
In the immediate future, each student has a serious attitude in studying and understands the basic contents of the Law on Military Officers and the Law on People's Public Security.
Through studying the Law on Military Officers and the Law on People's Public Security, students will understand the obligations, responsibilities and rights of military and police officers; understand the conditions for selection and additional training in the contingent of military officers and in the People's Public Security force. From there, know how to register for training to become army officers and police officers and soldiers.
Becoming an officer of the People's Army and People's Public Security is the honor and pride of the young generation.
In order to achieve their aspirations, first of all, each student needs to strive to study and practice to both hone and improve the necessary knowledge according to the major, as a basis after graduation to serve his day. better meet the requirements of society ; at the same time, we must try our best to study and follow Ho Chi Minh's moral example, actively learn about the nation's patriotic tradition, the heroic tradition of the People's Army and the Vietnam People's Public Security.
On the basis of clearly determining the desire to serve long-term in the Army and Public Security forces, after graduating from high school, each student can apply for an exam to enter the Army or People's Public Security schools.
Vietnam's revolutionary practice shows that the law is not only an important tool of the State, but also a key tool that each citizen uses to build his or her life and contribute to peace. order and development of the country. Students understand, follow the Constitution and the law is a civilized way of life that shows the moral and disciplined life of each person.

ACTIVITY ON CHILDREN SCHOOL
- Understand the meaning and effects of basic postures and movements on the battlefield of the individual.
- Be able to do postures and movements in combat.
- The first step is to know how to properly apply postures and movements to terrain, terrain and real situations.
I - MEANING, REQUEST
1. Meaning
Posture, movement are basic movements often used in combat to quickly, secretly close to the target, find ways to destroy the target.
2. Request
- Always observe the enemy, terrain, terrain and teammates, use appropriate movement postures.
- Acting cleverly, quickly, secretly.
II - BASIC POSITIONS, ACTIVITIES WHEN ACTIVITIES
1. The movement of stooping
Crouching is often used in cases where the enemy is close to the enemy's terrain, the terrain is obscured, the cover is high at chest level or the enemy fog is difficult to detect at night.
- Walk high when there are no obstacles
Preparation position:
The left foot takes a step forward, the toe of the foot is slightly tilted to the right, the right foot uses the toe to rotate the heel up for the person to lean to the right (minimize the target), both legs are slack, the weight is evenly distributed on both legs, from belly up and down, eyes on the enemy, orange left hand on hand, right hand holding the handle, index finger outside the trigger ring, gun face tilted to the left, barrel head as high as left eye, gun in ready position ready to fight (figure 6-1).
 

Figure 6-1. Preparations Figure 6-2. The movement of stooping
+ When advancing:
Step right foot up and put the whole foot on the ground, toe to the right, legs still slack. Just like that, the two legs take turns walking to the set position (Figure 6-2).
- Walking low, performing like walking high, only the legs are more slack, the body is lower.
- Crouching when there are obstacles: The basic action is like stooping in normal terrain, only the gun strap is strapped to the right shoulder, the right hand grips the palmrest, the arm is tightly clamped.floundering on the body, the left hand holds a camouflage branch or leaves the road to advance.
When carrying materials, weapons, equipment, basic movements as above, only different: guns on the back, two hands carrying materials, weapons, equipment.
Attention:
- In case of left-handedness, the movement is performed in reverse.
- When carrying a rifle, the movement of stooping is similar to that of carrying a submachine gun, only the right hand is holding the stock of the gun.
- When stooping, people must not undulate or hold a gun.
In combat, the gesture of stooping has no voice command. When practicing, the command can be used: "Go stooping high to prepare — Forward" ; "Going low".
2. The movement of running stooped
Running stooped is often used in cases where you need to move quickly from one terrain to another.
The basic movement is the same as the stooping movement, only different: faster speed, longer steps.
3. High crawling movement
Tall cows are often used in places near the enemy, with terrain and terrain as high as the sitting posture, but mainly used to maneuver through terrain and terrain that easily emit standing sounds such as: where bricks and tiles are , gravel, jagged rocks, dry branches, leaves, ... need to use hands to detect mines.
- Two-legged, one-armed cow: used when close to the enemy, ready to use a gun or one hand to detect mines, carry and hold weapons, equipment, ...
+ Standard posture bl: Person squatting, left foot first, right foot behind, feet slightly tiptoe, weight evenly placed on both toes, gun strap strapped to right shoulder, right hand cam cover hand, arm clamp the gun firmly to the body (figure 6-3).
+ When advancing
The person leans forward slightly, the five fingers of the left hand are folded forward (find a place to put their feet) against the ground in front of the right toes, then slowly spread out to gently push leaves, dry grass, ... to all sides, grab The tips of the fingers and left foot are at the base, gradually shift the body weight to the left, step up with the right foot and place the tip of the foot close to the left palm.
Shift the body weight to the two legs, bring the left hand forward, five fingers clasped in front of the left toe, perform the same movement as above. Just like that, the left hand, two toes of the foot coordinate with tweezers to make 2 sure 1 move to the specified position, eyes always observing the direction of the enemy.

Figure 6-3. Two-legged, one-armed crawling movement
- Two-legged, two-armed cow: used in case the gun is not needed, and the hand is not busy.
Basic movements like the two-legged, one-armed crawling movement, just different: the gun is strapped to the back, when moving forward, the leg's path will be detected 3 sure 1 move to the specified position (Figure 6-4). ).

Attention:
- When advancing, do not let the stock of the gun touch the ground, do not hit the feet.
- In a place with low grass, no mines... can hold camouflage leaves in his left hand.
When practicing, you can use voice commands: "Cow two feet high, prepare one hand - Tien"-, "Cow two feet high, two hands prepare - Forward".
4. Pear movement
The pear movement is often used when the enemy's tendons need to be narrow, the target needs to be narrow, the terrain and terrain are obscured, the cover is high at the level of the person sitting, the movement needs to be gentle and cautious.
a) High pear
- Preparation position: Person sitting on the ground, left buttock and left thigh on the ground, left leg bent so that the left thigh is nearly perpendicular to the forward direction, shin is nearly perpendicular to the thigh, right leg naturally straightens, arms left front left thigh, head slightly bowed. The right hand holds the armrest, the gun is on the thigh and shin, the gun is balanced on the left leg, the ammunition is facing outward, the barrel is slightly tilted to the left or the gun can be placed on the right hip (Figure 6-5) ).
 

Figure 6-5. The move to prepare for the high pear
- When advancing: Right leg is bent, put foot close to left foot, left hand is forward one arm, hand is slightly tilted to the right, using the strength of right foot and left hand to lift body off the terrain and push people forward. When
When the right leg is naturally straightened, put the left thigh and shin down. Qr said that the left hand and right foot coordinate to push the person to a certain position, always keeping an eye on the direction of the enemy (Figure 6-6).
 
Figure 6-6. High pear movement

b) Low pear
The basic movement is the same as the high pear, only different: when going forward, place the whole left forearm on the ground, the hand turns to the right, the head is lowered (Figure 6-7).
 
Figure 6-7. Low pear movement
When carrying materials, equipment, and equipment: The basic movements are the same as above, only the difference is: the gun is worn behind the back, placing the material on the shin or the hand clamps the material to place the material on the flank to advance.
Attention:
- In case of left-handedness, the movement is performed in reverse.
- Do not let the gun touch the ground.
When practicing, you can use the voice command: "Low high (low) prepare - Advance".
5. Sliding movement
Sliding is often used near the enemy, to detect and remove mines, to get through enemy fences, or when it is necessary to cross flat terrain, where hidden objects are as tall as a man.
a) Slither on flat terrain
- Preparation position: Person lying prone, gun placed on the right along the body, 25 - 30cm away from the body, the barrel of the gun is facing forward and at the same height as the pain, the magazine is facing out. Hands bent, elbows wider than shoulders, forearms and hands facing the ground close together and placed under the chin or slightly forward. The legs are straight, the toes of the feet are on the ground, the feet are naturally closed (Figure 6-8).
 
— When advancing: hands forward about 10.— 15cm, two toes are bent forward, use the strength of both hands and two toes to lift up and push forward, belly and chest glide on the ground, head down, chin close to the terrain, as if so coordinate two legs, two hands to advance, progress 2 to 3 beats, right hand hold the hand grip, bring the gun forward, put it lightly on the terrain, and then continue to advance.
h) Slithering in rough terrain
The basic movement is like crawling on flat terrain, just different: two arms bent, elbows close to the ribs, hands on armpits, lifting people higher to advance.
When carrying materials, weapons and equipment:
The basic movement is the same as above, just different: the gun is worn on the back, the material is placed along the right side of the body. When taking the material, the person leans to the left, the right leg is slightly bent, the hands bring the material forward, and then continue to move forward.
Notice:
- Do not let the gun touch surrounding objects.
- Do not put the gun over your head.
When practicing, you can use the voice command: ''Crawling to prepare - Forward
6. Forward movement
Rushing is often used when crossing open terrain, when the enemy stops fire. Jumping forward is performed in all standing, kneeling, lying positions...
- Jumping movements in high position:
While walking, walking, kneeling, sitting... with the right hand holding the gun, if you have other equipment, put the gun behind your back, hold the equipment with both hands, lean forward slightly, use the strength of your legs to bounce forward run fast. The process of transporting the gun into a ready-to-battle position.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great impacts on the social life of
Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as
in advance, leading to the fear of no job opportunities and unemployment.
Although the epidemic has caused difficulties for students, it is important
It is important that students stay calm, confident and step by step find a solution. Pandemic
Disease is also an opportunity for students to develop themselves, contribute to the community and
improve flexibility, adapt to actual conditions. That's why our group
decided to choose the topic: "Covid-19 affects the life of Vietnamese students" to do
The essay thereby will clarify the difficulties and challenges, the level of influence of the
epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.
The Covid 19 epidemic is an acute infectious respiratory disease that causes
caused by the coronavirus SARS COV-2 and its variants.
This disease first appeared in 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province
North, China. The causative agent is confirmed to be a new strain of corona virus.
The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans, and has been shown to spread from person to person
people, usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs or sneezes. Patient
symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus mainly affects
to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.
The outbreak of Covid-19 in Vietnam has had a great impact on learning as well
like the social life of Vietnamese students, especially students studying at
Universities in Ho Chi Minh City – where the epidemic is still taking place at present
stress.
First of all, on the issue of learning, due to the complicated epidemic situation, a series of
Universities move to online learning causing students to plan to gradually do
get used to this "new normal". Online learning has many advantages even in the current situation, but it also has many limitations. Online learning reduced
30% of the student's ability to absorb, and at the same time there are problems with the site
equipment as well as unstable Internet condition.2 Online learning requires students
must be proactive. One of the biggest concerns about this format is the lack of
interaction between faculty and students. For some practice modules, study is required
studying at a university, during the epidemic situation, it is not possible to conduct teaching
has a significant effect on the professional qualifications as well as the time to graduate from school.
Regarding social life, during the epidemic situation, most students returned to their hometowns,
but there are also a large number of students still in the epidemic area. Difficult economic conditions
difficult, the need for accommodation is a huge problem for students in this situation
the epidemic could not work part-time to cover life. Not only that, the activities
Clubs and social work have all stopped because of the impact of the epidemic
not insignificant to the training of skills and social knowledge in the university environment.
According to WorldOMeters, the website compiles demographic, economic, social and human indicators
people worldwide. As of 21:11, November 8, 2021, there are more than 250 . in the world
million cases and more than 5 million deaths in 230 countries and territories.

With such a large number of COVID-19 infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) is
The same concerns about the sequelae left by the virus. WHO urges patients who have

The pain of the pandemic has not yet found the best solution.
To date, very few people understand why some patients, after experiencing

periods of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction (scientific name is brain fog), confusion n
heart muscle and nerves.
Clinical care team leader in WHO emergencies, also
is the head of the "long COVID-19" research, said Janet Diaz so far
There are more than 200 reported symptoms associated with the post-COVID-19 syndrome, in
This includes symptoms such as chest pain, tingling, and a rash. According to Ms. Diaz, some
patients even have symptoms that persist from the acute phase; others
recovered, then relapsed, with symptoms appearing and disappearing on their own;
while others have symptoms that appear only after recovering from the acute phase
count. Ms. Diaz said some people have symptoms lasting up to 3 months, but there are also people up to 6 months, maybe even a small percentage lasting up to 9 months or so.
much longer.4
In addition to expanding research to understand and manage the post-COVID-19 syndrome, WHO is working to better devise rehabilitation programs for
people with "long COVID-19".
Since the outbreak of the epidemic in our country in early 2020, Vietnam has
recorded more than 1 million infections across all provinces and still growing rapidly, more than
850 thousand people have recovered, more than 120 thousand patients are being treated at hospitals, hospitals and clinics
isolated areas and at home and more than 22,000 deaths.

In Vietnam, the epidemic is developing seriously and complicatedly with many provinces and cities
The city must notify students to leave school to prevent epidemics. The pandemic has
causing many economic sectors to be seriously affected, many people suffer
work because he couldn't leave the house.Processing of communications occurs periodically throughout the process

The CPU resumes the execution of the user program at the breakpoint.
OBs control the execution of the user program. Each OB must have
a unique OB number. Some default OB numbers are reversed under the value
200. Other OBs must be numbered 200 or greater.
Specific events in the CPU trigger the execution of an organization block.
OBs cannot call each other or be called from an FC or FB. There is only one event

them, where OBs with higher priority are processed before OBs with higher priority
lower priority. The lowest priority class is 1 (for the main program cycle), and class
highest priority is 27 (for timing error interrupts).
Program cycle OBs execute cyclically while the CPU is at
RUN mode. The main block of the program is a program cycle OB. Here
is where we put the program control instructions and also where we call blocks

executed in numerical order. OB 1 is the default. Program cycle OBs
other must be identified as OB 200 or greater.
 OBs delay execution at a specified dwell time
after an event, configured by the start interrupt command (SRT_DINT).
The delay time is specified in the input parameter of the extend instruction.
CPU processing is controlled by events. Events that trigger the
OB interrupt to be executed. The interrupt OB for an event is specified during the process

DETACH. Some events occur on a background with a cycle-like system
program or cyclical events. Other events that only happen in one

event occurs when there is a hardware-triggered change, such as a
threshold event on an input point or a high-speed counter event. Addition
there are events such as diagnostic error events and time error events that occur only when there is a
error. Event priorities, groups, and priorities are used to determine order
self-handling for event interrupt OBs.
Program cycle event occurs once during each program cycle

Hardware interrupt events are triggered by a change in the

HSC case. There can be one interrupt OB selected for each hardware interrupt event. The
Hardware events are allowed in the Device configuration section. OBs are identified

The diagnostic error interrupt and timing error interrupt events are triggered when the CPU

in the diagnostic and timing error interrupt events.
The number of waiting (queuing) events from a single source is limited to
using a different row for each event type. Under reaching the limit of events
wait event for a given event type, the next event will be lost.
Each CPU event has an associated priority, and the priorities are assigned
classified into priority groups. The following table summarizes the queuing depths, the
priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB

The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle
does not complete within the specified maximum scan cycle time.
The requested OB cannot be initialized condition occurs when an OB is
requested by a cyclic interrupt or a time delay interrupt, but the OB is
That request has just been executed.
Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type. If an event occurs
When the corresponding queue is full, a time error event is generated.
All timing error events will trigger the execution of OB 80, if any. If
OB 80 does not exist, the CPU will ignore this error. If the two dark cycle time conditions

However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.
• Malaysia's model of enforcement agency (Pemandu)
Background: In 2009, the Malaysian government faced a series of dilemmas similar to many other developing countries, such as the middle-income trap, budget deficit ratio, and public debt ratio. is very large, the crime and corruption rate is high, the labor productivity is stagnant, the bureaucracy of the public administration is clearly revealed, from which people gradually lose confidence in the management process of the Government. government, losing faith in the promise that by 2020, Malaysia will become a high-income country. Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times. However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes.

Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.

Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as

epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.

to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.

In sociology, the concept of socialization is defined as
a cycle that introduces you to social norms and common customs
through social interaction. To help people develop their abilities
own and learn from society. In other words, socialization is their journey
We continuously absorb culture into our personality to live in harmony with society.
Socialization is an important foundation of human beings, unlike other creatures
On the other hand, people need to have social understanding to live. In addition to the substantial existence
Simply biological, social experience creates the personality of each person. Understand
In a simple sense, personality is a system of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that
organization in which people think and perceive the world and themselves
such as reactions and actions in social interactions.

The worship of animals is due to natural human curiosity.
Primitive man observed an animal with unique and inexplicable characteristics
Its likeability will appeal to human curiosity, curiosity is the result of
early man's observations of this particular feature and this wonder
eventually led to admiration. Therefore, primitive people worshiped the
Animals have inimitable characteristics. Other authors argue that worshiping
Animal offerings are derived from the names of the clans, who claim to be descendants of
animals and perform worship.
Life in the mountains and forests every day is faced with animals,
Most ethnic groups often believe that wild animals such as tigers, leopards, deer, and tigers are
sacred animal, both a valuable source of food and a sacrifice, containing
supernatural powers. If worshiped, the jungler will avoid disaster
when exploiting natural products, and as having more power. Apart from animals
In the forest, domestic animals such as buffaloes, cows, pigs, and chickens are said to be
animals with souls.
Therefore, animal worship is a very special belief of people

User program execution begins with one or more nested blocks
optional boot function (OB), is executed once while entering RUN mode, and
followed by one or more program cycle OBs that are executed one
cyclic way. The OB can also be associated with an interrupt event, which can be an event
standard interrupt or an error event, and execute whenever the standard or error event occurs
The corresponding error event occurs.
A function (FC) or function block (FB) is a block of program code that can be called
from an OB or from another FC or FB, down to the following levels.
FC is not associated with any part of a data block (DB), while FB
is directly attached to a DB and uses the DB to forward messages
numbers and stores temporary values ​​and results.
Size of user program, of data and of configurable
limited by available load memory and working memory in the CPU. There are no limits
for the number of blocks supported within the available working memory.
Each cycle consists of writing outputs, reading input, the execution of
user program instructions, and performing system or process maintenance
background logic. Cycle is referred to as one scan cycle or one scan.
Signal boards, signal modules and communication modules are recognized
and recorded only while the power is on.
Under the default configuration, all analog and digital I/O points are updated
updated synchronously with the scan cycle using an internal memory area
is called the process image. The process image contains a snapshot of inputs and outputs
physical output (I/O points on the CPU, on the signal board, and on the signal modules).
This cycle provides consistent logic throughout the execution of instructions
user for a given cycle and prevent flickering of the points
output, which can change state many times in the process image output area.
You can specify when numeric and analog I/O points are stored
in the progress image. If we insert a module in the device view, the data of
it is located in the progress image of the S7-1200 CPU (default). The CPU executes the change
Exchange data between the module and the progress image area automatically during the update
update of the progress image. To remove numeric or analog points from the update
automatically update the process image, we select the corresponding device in the Device configuration,
view the Properties tab, expand if necessary to set the desired I/O points, and then select
select “IO addresses/HW identifier”. Then change the entry for “Process image:”
from “Cyclic PI” to “---”. To add points back to the automatic update of the progress image,
change this selection back to “Cyclic PI”.
We can read input values ​​and write output values ​​immediately when a
execute command. An instant read will access the current state of the object input
handle and do not update the process image input region, regardless of whether a point is configured
image to be stored in the progress image. An instantaneous write to the physical output will update
Update the entire progress image output area (if a point is configured to be stored in
process image) and physical output point. We append the suffix ":P" to the I/O address if desired
The program immediately retrieves I/O data directly from the physical point instead
for using progress images.
The CPU performs a hot reboot before entering RUN mode. The
hot reboot will reset all retained memories to default boot values
specified, but keep the current values ​​stored in retained memory.
When you download a project element (such as a program block, a data block,
data or hardware configuration), the CPU performs a reboot during the switch
next to RUN mode. In addition to clearing inputs, initialize outputs and
initialize non-retainable memory, restart also activates
memory area that can be retained.
After a reboot following the download, all STOP conversions to
Sequential RUN will also perform a hot reboot (without triggering the memory
capable of holding).
The CPU supports a hot reboot to enter RUN mode. Restart
hot does not include a memory reset. All systems are not capable of keeping
and user data are both initialized at a hot reboot. Data
the user's ability to keep remains the same.
A reset memory erases all working memories, erasing possible memory areas
hold and non-hold, and copy the loaded memory to the working memory. One
memory reset does not erase diagnostic buffers or permanently stored values
of the IP address.
You can specify the CPU's power-on mode complete with the initialization method
restart using programming software. This configuration icon appears
in the Device Configuration section for the CPU in boot. When the source is
turned on, the CPU performs a sequence of power-on and system initialization diagnostic tests
system. The CPU will then go into power-on mode accordingly. Of course errors are detected
will now prevent the CPU from entering RUN mode. CPU supports power-on modes
The following.
When the operating state changes from STOP to RUN, the CPU clears the inputs
process image, initialize process image outputs, and execute startup OBs. Real
Any reads access the progress image inputs by instructions in the OBs
start will read zero value rather than the current physical input value. Therefore, to read
the current state of a physical input during boot mode, we must
perform an instant read. Start-up OBs and any associated FCs and FBs
authority will be executed next. If more than 1 startup OB exists, each of those OBs
will be executed in OB number order, in which the lowest OB number is executed
Firstly.
Each startup OB includes startup information that helps us determine validity
of the data stored and of the clock hour of the day. You can program commands n
in the startup OBs to check these startup values ​​and to perform the operation
fit. The following boot regions are supported by boot OBs.
For each scan cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the inputs, executes the program
user program, update communication modules, perform internal translation work
(housekeeping) and respond to user interrupt events and transmission requests
pine. Communication requests are processed periodically throughout the process
to scan.
These operations (except user interrupt events) are performed
regularly and in a sequential order. User interrupt events are fired
Activities will be served with priority in the order in which they appear.
The system guarantees that the scan cycle will be completed within a period of time
is called the maximum cycle time, otherwise a time error event will be generated
out.
 Each scan cycle begins by looking up the current values ​​of the outputs
digital or analog from the process image and then write them to the outputs
physical CPU, the SB and SM modules are configured for automatic I/O updates
dynamic (default configuration). When a physical output is accessed by an instruction,
both the output process image and the physical output itself are updated.
The scan cycle continues by reading the current values ​​of the digital inputs
or the like from the CPU, the SB, SM modules are configured for updating
I/O automatically (default configuration), and then writes these values ​​to the progress image
submit. When a physical input is accessed by an instruction, the value of input
The physical image is accessed, but the input process image is not updated.
 After reading the inputs, the user program is executed from the first instruction
first to the last command. This includes all chapter cycle OBs
program plus all their associated FCs and FBs. Cyclic OBs
The program is executed in order of OB number, where OB number is low
is executed first.Processing of communications occurs periodically throughout the process
scan, which can interrupt the execution of the user program.
Self-diagnostic tests include periodic checks of the system and
check the status of the I/O module.
Interrupts can occur during any part of the scan cycle, and are
event driven. When an event occurs, the CPU interrupts the scan cycle and calls OB .
configured to execute that event. After the OB finishes executing the event,
The CPU resumes the execution of the user program at the breakpoint.
OBs control the execution of the user program. Each OB must have
a unique OB number. Some default OB numbers are reversed under the value
200. Other OBs must be numbered 200 or greater.
Specific events in the CPU trigger the execution of an organization block.
OBs cannot call each other or be called from an FC or FB. There is only one event
startup, such as a diagnostic interrupt or a time interval, is possible
animate the execution of an OB. The CPU processes OBs according to their respective priority classes
them, where OBs with higher priority are processed before OBs with higher priority
lower priority. The lowest priority class is 1 (for the main program cycle), and class
highest priority is 27 (for timing error interrupts).
Program cycle OBs execute cyclically while the CPU is at
RUN mode. The main block of the program is a program cycle OB. Here
is where we put the program control instructions and also where we call blocks
additional users. Multiple program cycle OBs are allowed and allowed
executed in numerical order. OB 1 is the default. Program cycle OBs
other must be identified as OB 200 or greater.
 OBs delay execution at a specified dwell time
after an event, configured by the start interrupt command (SRT_DINT).
The delay time is specified in the input parameter of the extend instruction.
CPU processing is controlled by events. Events that trigger the
OB interrupt to be executed. The interrupt OB for an event is specified during the process
create the block, either in Device Configuration or with an ATTACH command or
DETACH. Some events occur on a background with a cycle-like system
program or cyclical events. Other events that only happen in one
short durations, like the start-up and time-delay events. Some
event occurs when there is a hardware-triggered change, such as a
threshold event on an input point or a high-speed counter event. Addition
there are events such as diagnostic error events and time error events that occur only when there is a
error. Event priorities, groups, and priorities are used to determine order
self-handling for event interrupt OBs.
Program cycle event occurs once during each program cycle
(or scan cycle). During the program cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the
entering and executing program cycle OBs. Program cycle event is required
and is always enabled. We may not have program cycle OBs, or have
Multiple OBs are selected for each program cycle event. After the cycle event
program is activated, the lowest numbered program cycle OB (usually
is OB 1) will be executed. Other program cycle OBs are executed
sequentially, in numbered order, only during the program cycle.
Cyclic interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupt at a configured interval. Configurable interval when OB
generated and selected to become a cyclic interrupt OB. Events
cyclic interrupt will interrupt the program cycle and execute the cyclic interrupt OB (event
cyclic events are in a higher priority group than program cycle events).
Only one cyclic interrupt OB can be attached to a cyclic event
submit. The CPU supports 4 cyclic interrupt events. Cyclic interrupt OBs have a
phase shift property, so execution of cyclic interrupts in cycle
The same time can be shifted from one time to another by one degree of shift
phase adjustment.
The startup event occurs once on the STOP to RUN transition and
causes the startup OB to be executed. Multiple OBs can be selected for the trigger event
motion. Startup OBs are executed in numbered order.
Time-delayed interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupts after a delay has elapsed. The delay time is determined with
SRT_DINT command. Time delay events interrupt the program cycle to execute
Time delay interrupt OB exam. Only one time delay interrupt OB is possible
attached to a time delay event. The CPU supports 4 time delay events.
Hardware interrupt events are triggered by a change in the
hard, for example a threshold tgain or threshold drop on an input point, or an event
HSC case. There can be one interrupt OB selected for each hardware interrupt event. The
Hardware events are allowed in the Device configuration section. OBs are identified
specified for an event in the Device configuration or with an ATTACH instruction in the
user program. The CPU supports several hardware interrupt events. Exact events
is based on the CPU type and number of input points.
The diagnostic error interrupt and timing error interrupt events are triggered when the CPU
detected an error. These events are in a higher priority group than events
other interrupts and can interrupt the execution of hardware interrupt delay events, periodic interrupts
program and time delay interrupt. An interrupt OB can be defined for each event
in the diagnostic and timing error interrupt events.
The number of waiting (queuing) events from a single source is limited to
using a different row for each event type. Under reaching the limit of events
wait event for a given event type, the next event will be lost.
Each CPU event has an associated priority, and the priorities are assigned
classified into priority groups. The following table summarizes the queuing depths, the
priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB
event) is approximately 210 microseconds, indicating that a program cycle OB is only
the event handler subroutine fires at the time of the interrupt event.
The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle
does not complete within the specified maximum scan cycle time.
The requested OB cannot be initialized condition occurs when an OB is
requested by a cyclic interrupt or a time delay interrupt, but the OB is
That request has just been executed.
Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type. If an event occurs
When the corresponding queue is full, a time error event is generated.
All timing error events will trigger the execution of OB 80, if any. If
OB 80 does not exist, the CPU will ignore this error. If the two dark cycle time conditions
exceeded occurs in the same program cycle without resetting the timer
then cycle, CPU will go into STOP mode, regardless of whether OB 80 exists or not.
OB 80 includes startup information that helps you determine which events and OBs have
generate error. You can program a script inside OB 80 to check initialization values
this action and to take the appropriate action. The following boot regions are supported
by OB 80:
All diagnostic error events will trigger the execution of OB 82 if it exists
in. If OB 82 does not exist, the CPU will then ignore the error. No OB 82 interrupt error
What diagnostics are present when you create a project. If desired, we add an OB 82 interrupt
Diagnostic error into the project by double clicking on “Add new block” below
“Program blocks”, then select “Organization block” and “Diagnostic error interrupt”.
OB 82 includes trigger information that helps us determine when an event is based
on the occurrence or removal of an error, and the device and channel that reported the error.
Bit 4 of IO_state indicates when the event was caused by occurrence or removal
of an error. Bit 4 will be 1 if an error is present (e.g. wire break) and 0 if error
not present.
The ladder input contains the hardware identifier (HW ID) of the device or units
function location returns an error. HW IDs are assigned automatically when components are
inserted into the device or network view and appears in the Constants tab of the recording cards
PLCs. A name is also automatically assigned to the HW ID. These entries
in the Constants tag of the PLC tags cannot be changed.
The channel number starts at 0 for the first input point (analog type
or digital) and starts at 64 for the first output point (analog or
numeric type). Various corrections are needed to distinguish the inputs from the
output in the event that the device contains both. If an error affects the complete equipment
tuning and functional units, i.e. without a source, the most significant bit of
channel number character to be set (channel number 32768).
The RE_TRIGR instruction (re-enable cycle time monitoring) allows us to
reset the timer then measure the cycle time. However, this command only works if it
is executed in an OB program cycle; RE_TRIGR command will be ignored if
is executed in OB 80. If the maximum scan cycle time is exceeded twice
in the same program cycle without RE_TRIGR instruction execution between both
twice, the CPU will then switch back to STOP immediately. The use of iterative executions
The repetition of the RE_TRIGR instruction can create an infinite loop or a very long scan cycle
long.
Usually, the scan cycle executes as fast as possible and the next scan
next starts as soon as the current scan cycle is complete. Depends on the program
user and communication tasks, the cycle time of each scan cycle can be
may vary between scan cycles. To eliminate this difference, the CPU supports a
Optional fixed minimum scan cycle time (also known as fixed scan cycle). When this optional function is activated and a scan cycle time is dark
fixed min is provided in milliseconds, CPU will maintain min cycle time
within ±1 ms for the completion of each CPU scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU completes the normal scan cycle in
time is less than the predetermined minimum scan cycle time, the CPU will use
additional scan cycle time to perform uptime diagnostics
and/or to process communication requests. In this way the CPU always takes a
fixed amount of time to complete a scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU is unable to complete the scan cycle within
Minimum cycle time is specified, the CPU will complete the scan cycle normally
normally (including communication processing) and does not generate any system response
as a result of exceeding the minimum scan time.
Load memory is a non-volatile storage area for human programs
usage, data and configuration. When a project is downloaded to the CPU, it first
stored in the load memory area. This area is placed in both a card
memory (if any) or in the CPU. This non-volatile memory is still maintained
when the power is lost. The memory card supports a larger storage space than the storage area
storage built into the CPU.
Working memory is a storage area for some elements of a human project
used while executing the user program. CPU copies a number
elements in the project from memory loaded into working memory. Variable Memory
This is lost when power is lost, and it is stored by the CPU when power is restored
restore.
Retained memory is a non-volatile storage area for a limited number of
limit working memory values. Retained memory area used for storage
values ​​of user-selected memory locations during
sourceless space. When the power is turned on again, the CPU has enough time to hold on
to maintain the values ​​of a limited number of special memory locations. The prices
This retained value is then restored when the power is turned on.
Bit memory (M): we can determine the exact width of memory for each tuple
Remember the bit in the PLC tag table or in the assignment list. Storage bit memory
always starts at MB0 and runs up successively to a specified number of
bytes. We determine this value from the PLC tag table or from the assignment list by
clicking on the “Retain” icon. Enter the number of bytes M to hold
start again at MB0.
Tags in a function block (FB): if a function block is created with box
“Symbolic access only” is selected, the editor interface for this FB then
will contain a column “Retain”. In this column, you can choose both “Retain” or
“Non-retain” separately for each record tag. An Instant DB has been created
output when this FB is placed in the editor will show this retain column, but
for display purposes only; We cannot change the save state from within the program
compose an instant DB interface for an FB that has been configured as
“Symbolic access only”.
If a FB was created with the “Symbolic access only” box unchecked,
This theme editor for FB will not include a “Retain” column. An Instant DB
was created when this FB was inserted in the editor the program will show
see an editable “Retain” column. In this case, choosing option
“Retain” for any tag will result in all tags selected.
Similarly, canceling the option selection for any tag will result in
All recording cards are deselected. For a configured FB that is not
“Symbolic access only”, we have tTo change the retention state from within the submission scope
instant DB editing, but all tags will be set to hold
together.
After creating FB, one cannot change the option for “Symbolic access
only”. This option can only be selected when the FB is created. To determine when
an existing FB configured for “Symbolic access only”, right click on FB
In the Project tree, select “Properties”, and then select “Attributes”.
A total of 2048 bytes of data can be held. To see how many bytes, word
PLC tab sheet or from the assignment list, click on the toolbar icon
"Retain". The second line will show the total remaining memory combined for M and DB, though
although this is where the retention ranges are defined for M.
The CPU supports a diagnostic buffer containing one entry per event
diagnose. Each entry includes the date and time the event occurred, a list of
event entry and an event description. The entries are displayed in order
time with the most recent event at the top. While the CPU maintains power, there is
The most recent 50 events are in this log. When the log is full, a new event will
replace the longest occurring event in the log. When the source is lost, 10 recent events
will be saved.
The CPU supports one hour of the day clock. A large capacitor provides power
amount required to keep the clock running for the duration that the CPU is powered off. Capacitors
This power is charged while the CPU is powered up. Arrive at least 2 hours after the CPU has
powered off, this large capacitor will be fully charged to keep the meter running for
Usually about 10 days.
Time of Day Clock is set according to the system time which is time
Coordinate Universal Time (UTC). There are commands to read system time
system (RD_SYS_T) or local time (RD_LOC_T). Local time is calculated in
how to use time zone and daylight saving correction that we set in
Device configuration section CPU Clock section.
We configure the hour of day clock for the CPU under the “Time of .” property
day". You can also activate daylight saving time and define the times
start and stop points for daylight saving time. To set up copper
hour of the day, you must be online and in the “Online &
Diagnostics” of the CPU. Use the “Set time of day” function.
The CPU initializes these bytes on the transition from STOP mode to mode
STARTUP. The bits of the timer memory change synchronously to the clock
CPU throughout STARTUP and RUN modes.
Each level allows known functions to be accessible without
a password. The default condition for the CPU is to have no restrictions and no
there is a password protection. To limit access to a CPU, we configure
Display the CPU properties and enter the password.
Entering a password over a network will not reduce the value of the password
password protection for the CPU. A password protected CPU allows only
unrestricted access to one user at a time. Secret protection
The password does not apply to the execution of the user program script including
communication functions. Entering the correct password will provide access to all
all functions.
PLC to PLC communication (using communication instruction set in code blocks)
is not restricted by the security level in the CPU. The HMI function is also not affected
limit.
STEP 7 Basic software facilitates symbolic programming. Pine
Usually, tags are created both in the PLC tag, in a data block, or in
interface at the top of an OB, FC or FB. These tags include name, data type,
data, corrections and legends. In addition, in a data block, an initial value has
can be established. You can use these tags when programming by entering
tag name in command parameter. Optionally, we can also enter the operand
independent (memory, device, size and offset) at the instruction parameter. Examples in
The following shows how to enter absolute operands. The % character is spelled
dynamically inserted before the absolute operand by the program editor. I can flip
change the view mode in the program editor to one of the following:
symbol (Symbolic), symbol and absolute (Symbolic and absolute) or absolute
(Absolute).
By adding “:P” to an address, we can immediately read the
to the digital or analog type of the CPU, SB, or SM. The difference between a retrieval
using I_:P instead of using I is that the data will come directly from the points
being accessed rather than from the input process image. Retrieve the referenced I_:P
to an “immediate read” access because the data is retrieved immediately from the source
rather than from a copy that was made the last time the input progress image
updated.
Since the physical input points receive their data directly from the field devices are connected to these points, writing to these points is prohibited.
That is to say, I_:P accesses are read-only, as opposed to I-accessibles
read or write.
I_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the possible inputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the inputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at I4.0, then
The input points can be accessed by addresses I4.0:P and I4.1:P or by IB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from I4.2:P through I4.7:P are not denied, but are not
are recognized, since these points are not used. Accesses to the IW4:P . address
and ID4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with the SB.
Since the physical output points directly control the connected field devices
to these points, reading from these points is prohibited. That means, the
Q_:P outputs are write-only, as opposed to Q accesses which can be read or written.
Q_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the outputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the outputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at Q4.0, then
Output points can be accessed by address Q4.0:P and Q4.1:P or by QB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from Q4.2:P to Q4.7:P are not denied, but
are not recognized, as these points are not used. Accesses to address
QW4:P and QD4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with SB.
Data types are used to specify the size of a data element
data as well as the manner in which the data is interpreted. Each command parameter supports at least
one data type, and some parameters also support multiple data types. We keep the pointer over
the parameter field of a command to see what data types are supported for a message
given number.
A formal parameter is an identifier on an instruction that marks the location of data
data used by that instruction (e.g. the IN1 input of an ADD instruction). Actual parameters
is actually a memory location or constant containing data used for an instruction (eg %MD400
“Number_of_Widgets”). The data type of the actual parameter is specified by the user
must match one of the official spec's supported data types
specified by the command.
When specifying an actual parameter, you must specify either a tag (symbol) or
an absolute memory address. Tags associated with a symbol name (tag name)
with a data type, a device, memory offset, and comment line, and can
created either in the PLC tag editor or in the Interface editor
for a block (OB, FC, FB or DB). If entering an absolute address without
tag related, one must use an appropriate size for the data type
supported, and a default tag will be created under the entry.
You can also enter constant values ​​for multiple input parameters. The following table
This describes the basic data types supported, including examples of fixed entry.
All types except String are available in the PLC tag editor
and in the block's Interface editor. The String type is only available in the editor
Draft the interface of the block. The following table defines the basic data types.
Real numbers (or floating point numbers) are displayed as numbers with precision
32-bit single-precision (Real) or 64-bit double-precision number (LReal) as described in
ANSI/IEEE 754-1985 standard. Single precision floating point numbers
accurate to up to 6 significant digits and double precision floating point numbers
is accurate to up to 15 significant digits. You can specify up to 6 significant digits
(Real type) or 15 significant digits (LReal) when entering a floating point constant
to maintain accuracy.
Calculations involving a long sequence of values ​​consisting of very large numbers or
very small can produce inaccurate results. This can occur if the numbers
less than 10 to the power of x, where x > 6 (Real type) or x > 15 (LReal type).
Example for Real: 100 000 000 + 1 = 100 000 000.
CPU supports String data type for storing a sequence of single byte characters
odd. The String data type contains a total character counter (the number of characters in the string) and
current character counter. String type provides up to 256 bytes for storing results
maximum total character count (1 byte), current character count result (1 byte) and max
254 characters, where each character is stored in 1 byte.
We can use orthogonal strings (constants) for command parameters of type
IN using single quotes. For example, a 3-character string 'ABC' might
is used as input to the IN parameter of the S_CONV instruction. You can also create string variables by selecting the data type “String” in the interface editor
