CHAPTER I. The Basics of Corruption
1. Some concepts of corruption
1.1. What is corruption?
Corruption is the illegal act of abusing positions and powers to enjoy material benefits, causing damage to property of the State, collectives and individuals, and infringing upon the proper operation of agencies and organizations. .
1.2. What is a crime of corruption?
In the 2015 Penal Code, there is no concept of corruption crimes but the concept of position crimes in general, which divides into two main groups of crimes: corrupt criminals and group of crimes about position. The 2015 Penal Code still maintains 7 criminalized acts of corruption, including: Property embezzlement; Bribery; Abuse of positions and powers to appropriate property; Abusing positions and powers while performing official duties; Abuse of power while performing official duties; Abusing positions and powers to influence others for personal gain; Fraud at work.
From the generalization of legal signs related to corruption crimes, it can be understood: “Corruption crimes are acts that are dangerous to society, specified in the Penal Code, infringing on proper and equitable activities. often by agencies or organizations, infringing upon the interests of the State, organizations and citizens, performed by persons with positions and powers while performing their official duties or tasks for the purpose of self-seeking.
2. Characteristic elements of corrupt behavior
2.1. The subject of corruption is a person with a position and authority
The characteristic of corruption is that the subject of the act must be a person with a position and authority. Persons with positions and powers include: cadres, civil servants and public employees;officers, professional soldiers, defense workers in agencies and units of the People's Army; officers, professional non-commissioned officers, officers, professional and technical non-commissioned officers in agencies and units of the People's Public Security; leaders and managers in State-owned enterprises; leading cadres and managers who are representatives of the State's capital contribution in enterprises; persons assigned to perform tasks or official duties have powers while performing such tasks or official duties (Clause 3, Article 1, 2005 Law on Anti-corruption).
This target group has specific characteristics compared to other target groups such as: they are usually people with a working and devoted history, so they have a lot of experience; systematically trained, are experts in many different fields; are those who have wide connections and certain social prestige and even economic strengths. These characteristics of the subject of corrupt acts are the factors that make it difficult to detect, investigate and adjudicate corrupt acts.
2.2. Corruption subjects take advantage of their assigned positions and powers
 "Abusing positions and powers" for personal gain is the second characteristic of corruption. When committing corrupt acts, corrupt persons must use their "positions and powers" as a means to benefit themselves, their families or others. This is the basic element to identify corrupt behavior. A person who has a position and power but does not abuse that position or power does not commit corrupt acts. However, not all acts of persons with positions and powers who have taken advantage of such positions and powers are considered corrupt acts. Here, there is an intersection between this behavior and other criminal acts, so it is important to pay attention when distinguishing corrupt acts from other illegal acts.
2.3. The purpose of corruption is self-seeking
 Corruption is intentional. The purpose of corrupt acts is self-seeking. If the subject commits an act unintentionally, it is not an act of corruption. Self-interest here is understood as a material benefit or a spiritual benefit that a person with a position or power has achieved or can achieve through corrupt acts. Thus, when dealing with corrupt acts, it is not obligatory for corrupt subjects to gain benefits.
3. Causes of corruption
Firstly, the system of policies and legal documents is complicated, lack of rigor and synchronization.
Article 12 of the 1992 Constitution stipulates: "The State manages society by law and constantly strengthens the socialist legislation"[6]. In order to strengthen the socialist legislation, in recent years, our state's legislative technique has developed significantly. The legal system was strong enough to cover all social relations, especially important and basic social relations... However, the number of legal documents promulgated increased, but the legal system did not. weak. Because, the legal documents in the legal system in Vietnam, when placed side by side, overlap and exclude each other. In Vietnam, a land of the people now has at least 3 regulatory documents: land law, civil law, administrative law... These legal documents have different adjustment methods, contradict each other. When applying, state agencies often use legal documents that are most beneficial to them and that is also one of the reasons leading to corruption.
The complexity, lack of rigor and synchronism of the policy and legal system leads to arbitrary application. At the same time, the frequent amendment, supplement, and change of documents and policies makes people, especially businesses, unable to update and grasp their rights and obligations in time.
In addition, when the law is not consistently applied and enforced, for example, the same requirement but the process of applying the law from the state management agency gives different results, Citizens or businesses may have to consider the solution of paying unofficial costs to the authorized person. This creates opportunities for arbitrary and corrupt acts for the benefit of those with positions and powers during the performance of their official duties. While people or businesses are willing to pay an unofficial fee in transactions with state agencies in order to be resolved more quickly the procedures.
Secondly, there is a lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units.
In an operating environment lacking publicity and transparency, when people with positions and powers are not pressured from thinking that all acts can be monitored by other entities, or that if actions are Whether detected is also difficult to assess due to lack of information or lack of clarity in publicly available information, they often tend to abuse their assigned power for self-seeking purposes. Therefore, the lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units is one of the reasons for creating favorable conditions for the implementation of corrupt acts.
Third, lack of a healthy competitive environment for activitiesbusiness action.
In a business environment where there is still a monopoly in the provision of services and goods, businesses, instead of improving their competitiveness in a healthy way, will seek to develop relationships with state agencies, state agencies, and other organizations. Business Partners. They are willing to pay unofficial costs to win big contracts or win tender packages to supply goods and equipment, especially in public procurement. The incompleteness of the legal provisions on bidding, the lack of mechanisms to control conflicts of interest, etc. are all conditions that promote the risk of committing corrupt acts.
Fourth, the remuneration regime is not satisfactory for the contingent of cadres, civil servants, public employees and employees in agencies, organizations, units and enterprises.
Vietnam belongs to the group of countries with a relatively complicated social transition. Traditional Confucian norms began to fade away as Vietnam came into contact with Western civilization through French colonialism. The newly established regime simulates Soviet social institutions with features such as dictatorship of the proletariat, collective mastery, centralized planning mechanism... After the VI Congress, the economy was switched to The market mechanism entails a series of other important changes in social structure and norms. Vietnam's modernization took place at the same time as globalization in the world, making Vietnam never before facing such rich and complex social changes as it is today. One limitation of Vietnam's social transition is that most of it takes place in passive circumstances. This makes the state of "disorder in social norms" during the transition in Vietnam even more severe when there is a complete lack of forecasts and coping plans. For example, the issue of salaries of civil servants. The difference in wages and remuneration in general between the state and non-state sectors, among enterprises themselves, gives rise to corruption motives of cadres, civil servants and public employees in various sectors. conflict of interest situations. The official salary and material benefits obtained from work are not enough to meet the living needs of themselves and their families, they will find ways to commit illegal acts for personal gain by the government. duties and powers created by them. The market mechanism has different standards of fairness, so it does not accept such income equality. And there is indeed a double standard in Vietnamese society on this issue, when in nominal terms the income between executive and leading civil servants is not much different, but in reality, the gap is quite large. very big. In summary, Vietnam is a typical model to study about the state of “normative disorder” in society; and this is also an important cause of corruption.

4. Harms and effects of corruption
4.1. About politics
Currently, corruption in our country has reached an extremely serious level, leading to many serious consequences. Corruption occurs not only at the central level, in major programs and projects, but also at the grassroots levels of government, which are in contact with the people on a daily basis.

The harmful effects of waste are a large amount of property of the State, the collective and each citizen.
4.3. About society
For the social aspect, the consequences of corruption are to change and upset social ethical standards, alienating the contingent of state officials and civil servants.
Before the illicit benefits obtained from performing corrupt acts; Many people with positions and interests have not kept their moral qualities. The assigned positions and powers are no longer used to serve the people, but are directed towards nefarious interests, despite violating the law, violating official duties, and immoral.
Corruption does not only occur in fields such as economics, finance, banking, etc. Which is gradually tending to spread to other fields - the fields ofIn areas where corruption is less likely to occur, such as culture, health, education, etc., it even spreads to areas that are considered impossible to have corrupt practices from a legal and ethical perspective such as social welfare or legal protection. The more so, the more serious and harmful the consequences of corruption in Vietnam will be.

Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great impacts on the social life of
Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as
in advance, leading to the fear of no job opportunities and unemployment.
Although the epidemic has caused difficulties for students, it is important
It is important that students stay calm, confident and step by step find a solution. Pandemic
Disease is also an opportunity for students to develop themselves, contribute to the community and
improve flexibility, adapt to actual conditions. That's why our group
decided to choose the topic: "Covid-19 affects the life of Vietnamese students" to do
The essay thereby will clarify the difficulties and challenges, the level of influence of the
epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.
The Covid 19 epidemic is an acute infectious respiratory disease that causes
caused by the coronavirus SARS COV-2 and its variants.
This disease first appeared in 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province
North, China. The causative agent is confirmed to be a new strain of corona virus.
The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans, and has been shown to spread from person to person
people, usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs or sneezes. Patient
symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus mainly affects
to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.
The outbreak of Covid-19 in Vietnam has had a great impact on learning as well
like the social life of Vietnamese students, especially students studying at
Universities in Ho Chi Minh City – where the epidemic is still taking place at present
stress.
First of all, on the issue of learning, due to the complicated epidemic situation, a series of
Universities move to online learning causing students to plan to gradually do
get used to this "new normal". Online learning has many advantages even in the current situation, but it also has many limitations. Online learning reduced
30% of the student's ability to absorb, and at the same time there are problems with the site
equipment as well as unstable Internet condition.2 Online learning requires students
must be proactive. One of the biggest concerns about this format is the lack of
interaction between faculty and students. For some practice modules, study is required
studying at a university, during the epidemic situation, it is not possible to conduct teaching
has a significant effect on the professional qualifications as well as the time to graduate from school.
Regarding social life, during the epidemic situation, most students returned to their hometowns,
but there are also a large number of students still in the epidemic area. Difficult economic conditions
difficult, the need for accommodation is a huge problem for students in this situation
the epidemic could not work part-time to cover life. Not only that, the activities
Clubs and social work have all stopped because of the impact of the epidemic
not insignificant to the training of skills and social knowledge in the university environment.
According to WorldOMeters, the website compiles demographic, economic, social and human indicators
people worldwide. As of 21:11, November 8, 2021, there are more than 250 . in the world
million cases and more than 5 million deaths in 230 countries and territories.

With such a large number of COVID-19 infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) is
The same concerns about the sequelae left by the virus. WHO urges patients who have
After being treated for COVID-19 and being affected by the sequelae left by the disease,
should seek medical help. Because until now the sequelae are still a pain
The pain of the pandemic has not yet found the best solution.
To date, very few people understand why some patients, after experiencing
through the acute phase, still suffers from symptoms such as shortness of breath, extreme

Chapter II: The current state of corruption in Vietnam

Chapter III: Anti-corruption solutions

Chapter V: Roles and responsibilities of society in anti-corruption
CHAPTER I. The Basics of Corruption
1. Some concepts of corruption
1.1. What is corruption?
Corruption is the illegal act of abusing positions and powers to enjoy material benefits, causing damage to property of the State, collectives and individuals, and infringing upon the proper operation of agencies and organizations. .
1.2. What is a crime of corruption?
In the 2015 Penal Code, there is no concept of corruption crimes but the concept of position crimes in general, which divides into two main groups of crimes: corrupt criminals and group of crimes about position. The 2015 Penal Code still maintains 7 criminalized acts of corruption, including: Property embezzlement; Bribery; Abuse of positions and powers to appropriate property; Abusing positions and powers while performing official duties; Abuse of power while performing official duties; Abusing positions and powers to influence others for personal gain; Fraud at work.
From the generalization of legal signs related to corruption crimes, it can be understood: “Corruption crimes are acts that are dangerous to society, specified in the Penal Code, infringing on proper and equitable activities. often by agencies or organizations, infringing upon the interests of the State, organizations and citizens, performed by persons with positions and powers while performing their official duties or tasks for the purpose of self-seeking.
2. Characteristic elements of corrupt behavior
2.1. The subject of corruption is a person with a position and authority
The characteristic of corruption is that the subject of the act must be a person with a position and authority. Persons with positions and powers include: cadres, civil servants and public employees;officers, professional soldiers, defense workers in agencies and units of the People's Army; officers, professional non-commissioned officers, officers, professional and technical non-commissioned officers in agencies and units of the People's Public Security; leaders and managers in State-owned enterprises; leading cadres and managers who are representatives of the State's capital contribution in enterprises; persons assigned to perform tasks or official duties have powers while performing such tasks or official duties (Clause 3, Article 1, 2005 Law on Anti-corruption).
This target group has specific characteristics compared to other target groups such as: they are usually people with a working and devoted history, so they have a lot of experience; systematically trained, are experts in many different fields; are those who have wide connections and certain social prestige and even economic strengths. These characteristics of the subject of corrupt acts are the factors that make it difficult to detect, investigate and adjudicate corrupt acts.
2.2. Corruption subjects take advantage of their assigned positions and powers
 "Abusing positions and powers" for personal gain is the second characteristic of corruption. When committing corrupt acts, corrupt persons must use their "positions and powers" as a means to benefit themselves, their families or others. This is the basic element to identify corrupt behavior. A person who has a position and power but does not abuse that position or power does not commit corrupt acts. However, not all acts of persons with positions and powers who have taken advantage of such positions and powers are considered corrupt acts. Here, there is an intersection between this behavior and other criminal acts, so it is important to pay attention when distinguishing corrupt acts from other illegal acts.
2.3. The purpose of corruption is self-seeking
 Corruption is intentional. The purpose of corrupt acts is self-seeking. If the subject commits an act unintentionally, it is not an act of corruption. Self-interest here is understood as a material benefit or a spiritual benefit that a person with a position or power has achieved or can achieve through corrupt acts. Thus, when dealing with corrupt acts, it is not obligatory for corrupt subjects to gain benefits.
3. Causes of corruption
Firstly, the system of policies and legal documents is complicated, lack of rigor and synchronization.
Article 12 of the 1992 Constitution stipulates: "The State manages society by law and constantly strengthens the socialist legislation"[6]. In order to strengthen the socialist legislation, in recent years, our state's legislative technique has developed significantly. The legal system was strong enough to cover all social relations, especially important and basic social relations... However, the number of legal documents promulgated increased, but the legal system did not. weak. Because, the legal documents in the legal system in Vietnam, when placed side by side, overlap and exclude each other. In Vietnam, a land of the people now has at least 3 regulatory documents: land law, civil law, administrative law... These legal documents have different adjustment methods, contradict each other. When applying, state agencies often use legal documents that are most beneficial to them and that is also one of the reasons leading to corruption.
The complexity, lack of rigor and synchronism of the policy and legal system leads to arbitrary application. At the same time, the frequent amendment, supplement, and change of documents and policies makes people, especially businesses, unable to update and grasp their rights and obligations in time.
In addition, when the law is not consistently applied and enforced, for example, the same requirement but the process of applying the law from the state management agency gives different results, Citizens or businesses may have to consider the solution of paying unofficial costs to the authorized person. This creates opportunities for arbitrary and corrupt acts for the benefit of those with positions and powers during the performance of their official duties. While people or businesses are willing to pay an unofficial fee in transactions with state agencies in order to be resolved more quickly the procedures.
Secondly, there is a lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units.
In an operating environment lacking publicity and transparency, when people with positions and powers are not pressured from thinking that all acts can be monitored by other entities, or that if actions are Whether detected is also difficult to assess due to lack of information or lack of clarity in publicly available information, they often tend to abuse their assigned power for self-seeking purposes. Therefore, the lack of publicity and transparency in the activities of agencies, organizations and units is one of the reasons for creating favorable conditions for the implementation of corrupt acts.
Third, lack of a healthy competitive environment for activitiesbusiness action.
In a business environment where there is still a monopoly in the provision of services and goods, businesses, instead of improving their competitiveness in a healthy way, will seek to develop relationships with state agencies, state agencies, and other organizations. Business Partners. They are willing to pay unofficial costs to win big contracts or win tender packages to supply goods and equipment, especially in public procurement. The incompleteness of the legal provisions on bidding, the lack of mechanisms to control conflicts of interest, etc. are all conditions that promote the risk of committing corrupt acts.
Fourth, the remuneration regime is not satisfactory for the contingent of cadres, civil servants, public employees and employees in agencies, organizations, units and enterprises.
Vietnam belongs to the group of countries with a relatively complicated social transition. Traditional Confucian norms began to fade away as Vietnam came into contact with Western civilization through French colonialism. The newly established regime simulates Soviet social institutions with features such as dictatorship of the proletariat, collective mastery, centralized planning mechanism... After the VI Congress, the economy was switched to The market mechanism entails a series of other important changes in social structure and norms. Vietnam's modernization took place at the same time as globalization in the world, making Vietnam never before facing such rich and complex social changes as it is today. One limitation of Vietnam's social transition is that most of it takes place in passive circumstances. This makes the state of "disorder in social norms" during the transition in Vietnam even more severe when there is a complete lack of forecasts and coping plans. For example, the issue of salaries of civil servants. The difference in wages and remuneration in general between the state and non-state sectors, among enterprises themselves, gives rise to corruption motives of cadres, civil servants and public employees in various sectors. conflict of interest situations. The official salary and material benefits obtained from work are not enough to meet the living needs of themselves and their families, they will find ways to commit illegal acts for personal gain by the government. duties and powers created by them. The market mechanism has different standards of fairness, so it does not accept such income equality. And there is indeed a double standard in Vietnamese society on this issue, when in nominal terms the income between executive and leading civil servants is not much different, but in reality, the gap is quite large. very big. In summary, Vietnam is a typical model to study about the state of “normative disorder” in society; and this is also an important cause of corruption.

4. Harms and effects of corruption
4.1. About politics
Currently, corruption in our country has reached an extremely serious level, leading to many serious consequences. Corruption occurs not only at the central level, in major programs and projects, but also at the grassroots levels of government, which are in contact with the people on a daily basis.

The harmful effects of waste are a large amount of property of the State, the collective and each citizen.
4.3. About society
For the social aspect, the consequences of corruption are to change and upset social ethical standards, alienating the contingent of state officials and civil servants.
Before the illicit benefits obtained from performing corrupt acts; Many people with positions and interests have not kept their moral qualities. The assigned positions and powers are no longer used to serve the people, but are directed towards nefarious interests, despite violating the law, violating official duties, and immoral.
Corruption does not only occur in fields such as economics, finance, banking, etc. Which is gradually tending to spread to other fields - the fields ofIn areas where corruption is less likely to occur, such as culture, health, education, etc., it even spreads to areas that are considered impossible to have corrupt practices from a legal and ethical perspective such as social welfare or legal protection.

Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great impacts on the social life of
Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as
in advance, leading to the fear of no job opportunities and unemployment.
Although the epidemic has caused difficulties for students, it is important
It is important that students stay calm, confident and step by step find a solution. Pandemic
Disease is also an opportunity for students to develop themselves, contribute to the community and
improve flexibility, adapt to actual conditions. That's why our group
decided to choose the topic: "Covid-19 affects the life of Vietnamese students" to do
The essay thereby will clarify the difficulties and challenges, the level of influence of the
epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.
The Covid 19 epidemic is an acute infectious respiratory disease that causes
caused by the coronavirus SARS COV-2 and its variants.
This disease first appeared in 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province
North, China. The causative agent is confirmed to be a new strain of corona virus.
The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans, and has been shown to spread from person to person
people, usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs or sneezes. Patient
symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus mainly affects
to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.
The outbreak of Covid-19 in Vietnam has had a great impact on learning as well
like the social life of Vietnamese students, especially students studying at
Universities in Ho Chi Minh City – where the epidemic is still taking place at present
stress.
First of all, on the issue of learning, due to the complicated epidemic situation, a series of
Universities move to online learning causing students to plan to gradually do
get used to this "new normal". Online learning has many advantages even in the current situation, but it also has many limitations. Online learning reduced
30% of the student's ability to absorb, and at the same time there are problems with the site
equipment as well as unstable Internet condition.2 Online learning requires students
must be proactive. One of the biggest concerns about this format is the lack of
interaction between faculty and students. For some practice modules, study is required
studying at a university, during the epidemic situation, it is not possible to conduct teaching
has a significant effect on the professional qualifications as well as the time to graduate from school.
Regarding social life, during the epidemic situation, most students returned to their hometowns,
but there are also a large number of students still in the epidemic area. Difficult economic conditions
difficult, the need for accommodation is a huge problem for students in this situation

Ill - RESPONSIBILITIES OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PARTICIPANTS IN BUILDING THE TEAM OF TEAM OF TEAM OFFICERS, WITH SECURE
Defending the Fatherland of Vietnam, a literate society, is a sacred duty and a noble right of citizens, in which high school students have an important role. The Party's line, the State's laws and the legitimate aspirations of the youth can only be realized by practical actions, demonstrating the civic responsibility of students in the new era. So. In addition to actively studying and improving their cultural level, students need to study, understand and strictly comply with the State's laws, including the Military Law and the People's Public Security Law.
In the immediate future, each student has a serious attitude in studying and understands the basic contents of the Law on Military Officers and the Law on People's Public Security.
Through studying the Law on Military Officers and the Law on People's Public Security, students will understand the obligations, responsibilities and rights of military and police officers; understand the conditions for selection and additional training in the contingent of military officers and in the People's Public Security force. From there, know how to register for training to become army officers and police officers and soldiers.
Becoming an officer of the People's Army and People's Public Security is the honor and pride of the young generation.
In order to achieve their aspirations, first of all, each student needs to strive to study and practice to both hone and improve the necessary knowledge according to the major, as a basis after graduation to serve his day. better meet the requirements of society ; at the same time, we must try our best to study and follow Ho Chi Minh's moral example, actively learn about the nation's patriotic tradition, the heroic tradition of the People's Army and the Vietnam People's Public Security.
On the basis of clearly determining the desire to serve long-term in the Army and Public Security forces, after graduating from high school, each student can apply for an exam to enter the Army or People's Public Security schools.
Vietnam's revolutionary practice shows that the law is not only an important tool of the State, but also a key tool that each citizen uses to build his or her life and contribute to peace. order and development of the country. Students understand, follow the Constitution and the law is a civilized way of life that shows the moral and disciplined life of each person.

ACTIVITY ON CHILDREN SCHOOL
- Understand the meaning and effects of basic postures and movements on the battlefield of the individual.
- Be able to do postures and movements in combat.
- The first step is to know how to properly apply postures and movements to terrain, terrain and real situations.
I - MEANING, REQUEST
1. Meaning
Posture, movement are basic movements often used in combat to quickly, secretly close to the target, find ways to destroy the target.
2. Request
- Always observe the enemy, terrain, terrain and teammates, use appropriate movement postures.
- Acting cleverly, quickly, secretly.
II - BASIC POSITIONS, ACTIVITIES WHEN ACTIVITIES
1. The movement of stooping
Crouching is often used in cases where the enemy is close to the enemy's terrain, the terrain is obscured, the cover is high at chest level or the enemy fog is difficult to detect at night.
- Walk high when there are no obstacles
Preparation position:
The left foot takes a step forward, the toe of the foot is slightly tilted to the right, the right foot uses the toe to rotate the heel up for the person to lean to the right (minimize the target), both legs are slack, the weight is evenly distributed on both legs, from belly up and down, eyes on the enemy, orange left hand on hand, right hand holding the handle, index finger outside the trigger ring, gun face tilted to the left, barrel head as high as left eye, gun in ready position ready to fight (figure 6-1).
 

Figure 6-1. Preparations Figure 6-2. The movement of stooping
+ When advancing:
Step right foot up and put the whole foot on the ground, toe to the right, legs still slack. Just like that, the two legs take turns walking to the set position (Figure 6-2).
- Walking low, performing like walking high, only the legs are more slack, the body is lower.
- Crouching when there are obstacles: The basic action is like stooping in normal terrain, only the gun strap is strapped to the right shoulder, the right hand grips the palmrest, the arm is tightly clamped.floundering on the body, the left hand holds a camouflage branch or leaves the road to advance.
When carrying materials, weapons, equipment, basic movements as above, only different: guns on the back, two hands carrying materials, weapons, equipment.
Attention:
- In case of left-handedness, the movement is performed in reverse.
- When carrying a rifle, the movement of stooping is similar to that of carrying a submachine gun, only the right hand is holding the stock of the gun.
- When stooping, people must not undulate or hold a gun.
In combat, the gesture of stooping has no voice command. When practicing, the command can be used: "Go stooping high to prepare — Forward" ; "Going low".
2. The movement of running stooped
Running stooped is often used in cases where you need to move quickly from one terrain to another.
The basic movement is the same as the stooping movement, only different: faster speed, longer steps.
3. High crawling movement
Tall cows are often used in places near the enemy, with terrain and terrain as high as the sitting posture, but mainly used to maneuver through terrain and terrain that easily emit standing sounds such as: where bricks and tiles are , gravel, jagged rocks, dry branches, leaves, ... need to use hands to detect mines.
- Two-legged, one-armed cow: used when close to the enemy, ready to use a gun or one hand to detect mines, carry and hold weapons, equipment, ...
+ Standard posture bl: Person squatting, left foot first, right foot behind, feet slightly tiptoe, weight evenly placed on both toes, gun strap strapped to right shoulder, right hand cam cover hand, arm clamp the gun firmly to the body (figure 6-3).
+ When advancing
The person leans forward slightly, the five fingers of the left hand are folded forward (find a place to put their feet) against the ground in front of the right toes, then slowly spread out to gently push leaves, dry grass, ... to all sides, grab The tips of the fingers and left foot are at the base, gradually shift the body weight to the left, step up with the right foot and place the tip of the foot close to the left palm.
Shift the body weight to the two legs, bring the left hand forward, five fingers clasped in front of the left toe, perform the same movement as above. Just like that, the left hand, two toes of the foot coordinate with tweezers to make 2 sure 1 move to the specified position, eyes always observing the direction of the enemy.

Figure 6-3. Two-legged, one-armed crawling movement
- Two-legged, two-armed cow: used in case the gun is not needed, and the hand is not busy.
Basic movements like the two-legged, one-armed crawling movement, just different: the gun is strapped to the back, when moving forward, the leg's path will be detected 3 sure 1 move to the specified position (Figure 6-4). ).

Attention:
- When advancing, do not let the stock of the gun touch the ground, do not hit the feet.
- In a place with low grass, no mines... can hold camouflage leaves in his left hand.
When practicing, you can use voice commands: "Cow two feet high, prepare one hand - Tien"-, "Cow two feet high, two hands prepare - Forward".
4. Pear movement
The pear movement is often used when the enemy's tendons need to be narrow, the target needs to be narrow, the terrain and terrain are obscured, the cover is high at the level of the person sitting, the movement needs to be gentle and cautious.
a) High pear
- Preparation position: Person sitting on the ground, left buttock and left thigh on the ground, left leg bent so that the left thigh is nearly perpendicular to the forward direction, shin is nearly perpendicular to the thigh, right leg naturally straightens, arms left front left thigh, head slightly bowed. The right hand holds the armrest, the gun is on the thigh and shin, the gun is balanced on the left leg, the ammunition is facing outward, the barrel is slightly tilted to the left or the gun can be placed on the right hip (Figure 6-5) ).
 

Figure 6-5. The move to prepare for the high pear
- When advancing: Right leg is bent, put foot close to left foot, left hand is forward one arm, hand is slightly tilted to the right, using the strength of right foot and left hand to lift body off the terrain and push people forward. When
When the right leg is naturally straightened, put the left thigh and shin down. Qr said that the left hand and right foot coordinate to push the person to a certain position, always keeping an eye on the direction of the enemy (Figure 6-6).
 
Figure 6-6. High pear movement

b) Low pear
The basic movement is the same as the high pear, only different: when going forward, place the whole left forearm on the ground, the hand turns to the right, the head is lowered (Figure 6-7).
 
Figure 6-7. Low pear movement
When carrying materials, equipment, and equipment: The basic movements are the same as above, only the difference is: the gun is worn behind the back, placing the material on the shin or the hand clamps the material to place the material on the flank to advance.
Attention:
- In case of left-handedness, the movement is performed in reverse.
- Do not let the gun touch the ground.
When practicing, you can use the voice command: "Low high (low) prepare - Advance".
5. Sliding movement
Sliding is often used near the enemy, to detect and remove mines, to get through enemy fences, or when it is necessary to cross flat terrain, where hidden objects are as tall as a man.
a) Slither on flat terrain
- Preparation position: Person lying prone, gun placed on the right along the body, 25 - 30cm away from the body, the barrel of the gun is facing forward and at the same height as the pain, the magazine is facing out. Hands bent, elbows wider than shoulders, forearms and hands facing the ground close together and placed under the chin or slightly forward. The legs are straight, the toes of the feet are on the ground, the feet are naturally closed (Figure 6-8).
 
— When advancing: hands forward about 10.— 15cm, two toes are bent forward, use the strength of both hands and two toes to lift up and push forward, belly and chest glide on the ground, head down, chin close to the terrain, as if so coordinate two legs, two hands to advance, progress 2 to 3 beats, right hand hold the hand grip, bring the gun forward, put it lightly on the terrain, and then continue to advance.
h) Slithering in rough terrain
The basic movement is like crawling on flat terrain, just different: two arms bent, elbows close to the ribs, hands on armpits, lifting people higher to advance.
When carrying materials, weapons and equipment:
The basic movement is the same as above, just different: the gun is worn on the back, the material is placed along the right side of the body. When taking the material, the person leans to the left, the right leg is slightly bent, the hands bring the material forward, and then continue to move forward.
Notice:
- Do not let the gun touch surrounding objects.
- Do not put the gun over your head.
When practicing, you can use the voice command: ''Crawling to prepare - Forward
6. Forward movement
Rushing is often used when crossing open terrain, when the enemy stops fire. Jumping forward is performed in all standing, kneeling, lying positions...
- Jumping movements in high position:
While walking, walking, kneeling, sitting... with the right hand holding the gun, if you have other equipment, put the gun behind your back, hold the equipment with both hands, lean forward slightly, use the strength of your legs to bounce forward run fast. The process of transporting the gun into a ready-to-battle position.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused great impacts on the social life of
Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as
in advance, leading to the fear of no job opportunities and unemployment.
Although the epidemic has caused difficulties for students, it is important
It is important that students stay calm, confident and step by step find a solution. Pandemic
Disease is also an opportunity for students to develop themselves, contribute to the community and
improve flexibility, adapt to actual conditions. That's why our group
decided to choose the topic: "Covid-19 affects the life of Vietnamese students" to do
The essay thereby will clarify the difficulties and challenges, the level of influence of the
epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.
The Covid 19 epidemic is an acute infectious respiratory disease that causes
caused by the coronavirus SARS COV-2 and its variants.
This disease first appeared in 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province
North, China. The causative agent is confirmed to be a new strain of corona virus.
The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans, and has been shown to spread from person to person
people, usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, coughs or sneezes. Patient
symptoms after an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus mainly affects
to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.
The outbreak of Covid-19 in Vietnam has had a great impact on learning as well
like the social life of Vietnamese students, especially students studying at
Universities in Ho Chi Minh City – where the epidemic is still taking place at present
stress.
First of all, on the issue of learning, due to the complicated epidemic situation, a series of
Universities move to online learning causing students to plan to gradually do
get used to this "new normal". Online learning has many advantages even in the current situation, but it also has many limitations. Online learning reduced
30% of the student's ability to absorb, and at the same time there are problems with the site
equipment as well as unstable Internet condition.2 Online learning requires students
must be proactive. One of the biggest concerns about this format is the lack of
interaction between faculty and students. For some practice modules, study is required
studying at a university, during the epidemic situation, it is not possible to conduct teaching
has a significant effect on the professional qualifications as well as the time to graduate from school.
Regarding social life, during the epidemic situation, most students returned to their hometowns,
but there are also a large number of students still in the epidemic area. Difficult economic conditions
difficult, the need for accommodation is a huge problem for students in this situation
the epidemic could not work part-time to cover life. Not only that, the activities
Clubs and social work have all stopped because of the impact of the epidemic
not insignificant to the training of skills and social knowledge in the university environment.
According to WorldOMeters, the website compiles demographic, economic, social and human indicators
people worldwide. As of 21:11, November 8, 2021, there are more than 250 . in the world
million cases and more than 5 million deaths in 230 countries and territories.

With such a large number of COVID-19 infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) is
The same concerns about the sequelae left by the virus. WHO urges patients who have

The pain of the pandemic has not yet found the best solution.
To date, very few people understand why some patients, after experiencing

periods of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction (scientific name is brain fog), confusion n
heart muscle and nerves.
Clinical care team leader in WHO emergencies, also
is the head of the "long COVID-19" research, said Janet Diaz so far
There are more than 200 reported symptoms associated with the post-COVID-19 syndrome, in
This includes symptoms such as chest pain, tingling, and a rash. According to Ms. Diaz, some
patients even have symptoms that persist from the acute phase; others
recovered, then relapsed, with symptoms appearing and disappearing on their own;
while others have symptoms that appear only after recovering from the acute phase
count. Ms. Diaz said some people have symptoms lasting up to 3 months, but there are also people up to 6 months, maybe even a small percentage lasting up to 9 months or so.
much longer.4
In addition to expanding research to understand and manage the post-COVID-19 syndrome, WHO is working to better devise rehabilitation programs for
people with "long COVID-19".
Since the outbreak of the epidemic in our country in early 2020, Vietnam has
recorded more than 1 million infections across all provinces and still growing rapidly, more than
850 thousand people have recovered, more than 120 thousand patients are being treated at hospitals, hospitals and clinics
isolated areas and at home and more than 22,000 deaths.

In Vietnam, the epidemic is developing seriously and complicatedly with many provinces and cities
The city must notify students to leave school to prevent epidemics. The pandemic has
causing many economic sectors to be seriously affected, many people suffer
work because he couldn't leave the house.Processing of communications occurs periodically throughout the process

The CPU resumes the execution of the user program at the breakpoint.
OBs control the execution of the user program. Each OB must have
a unique OB number. Some default OB numbers are reversed under the value
200. Other OBs must be numbered 200 or greater.
Specific events in the CPU trigger the execution of an organization block.
OBs cannot call each other or be called from an FC or FB. There is only one event

them, where OBs with higher priority are processed before OBs with higher priority
lower priority. The lowest priority class is 1 (for the main program cycle), and class
highest priority is 27 (for timing error interrupts).
Program cycle OBs execute cyclically while the CPU is at
RUN mode. The main block of the program is a program cycle OB. Here
is where we put the program control instructions and also where we call blocks

executed in numerical order. OB 1 is the default. Program cycle OBs
other must be identified as OB 200 or greater.
 OBs delay execution at a specified dwell time
after an event, configured by the start interrupt command (SRT_DINT).
The delay time is specified in the input parameter of the extend instruction.
CPU processing is controlled by events. Events that trigger the
OB interrupt to be executed. The interrupt OB for an event is specified during the process

DETACH. Some events occur on a background with a cycle-like system
program or cyclical events. Other events that only happen in one

event occurs when there is a hardware-triggered change, such as a
threshold event on an input point or a high-speed counter event. Addition
there are events such as diagnostic error events and time error events that occur only when there is a
error. Event priorities, groups, and priorities are used to determine order
self-handling for event interrupt OBs.
Program cycle event occurs once during each program cycle

Hardware interrupt events are triggered by a change in the

HSC case. There can be one interrupt OB selected for each hardware interrupt event. The
Hardware events are allowed in the Device configuration section. OBs are identified

The diagnostic error interrupt and timing error interrupt events are triggered when the CPU

in the diagnostic and timing error interrupt events.
The number of waiting (queuing) events from a single source is limited to
using a different row for each event type. Under reaching the limit of events
wait event for a given event type, the next event will be lost.
Each CPU event has an associated priority, and the priorities are assigned
classified into priority groups. The following table summarizes the queuing depths, the
priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB

The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle
does not complete within the specified maximum scan cycle time.
The requested OB cannot be initialized condition occurs when an OB is
requested by a cyclic interrupt or a time delay interrupt, but the OB is
That request has just been executed.
Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type. If an event occurs
When the corresponding queue is full, a time error event is generated.
All timing error events will trigger the execution of OB 80, if any. If
OB 80 does not exist, the CPU will ignore this error. If the two dark cycle time conditions

However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.
• Malaysia's model of enforcement agency (Pemandu)
Background: In 2009, the Malaysian government faced a series of dilemmas similar to many other developing countries, such as the middle-income trap, budget deficit ratio, and public debt ratio. is very large, the crime and corruption rate is high, the labor productivity is stagnant, the bureaucracy of the public administration is clearly revealed, from which people gradually lose confidence in the management process of the Government. government, losing faith in the promise that by 2020, Malaysia will become a high-income country. Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times. However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes.

Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.

Vietnamese students in particular and international students in general. Faced with a complicated situation
complexity and stress of the epidemic, many universities, colleges and centers
Research has temporarily stopped allowing students to come to school and participate in the implementation of the project.
This greatly affects the opportunities for students to practice and communicate face-to-face.
COVID-19 also affects the career opportunities of every student, especially students
about to graduate. The epidemic also caused many units and businesses to close and stop working
moving or reducing personnel, so the recruitment demand is not as many and diverse as

epidemic on student life, express opinions as well as raise consequences
to society and the country.

to the respiratory tract with common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue
Furthermore, respiratory infections, sepsis, septic shock and even
may cause death. At present, the disease is often attempted to control clinical symptoms
because there is no cure yet.
The name of the disease must both describe the agent and the manifestation of the disease, so it is often very long.
Long, complicated problems make it difficult to pronounce. So February 11th
2020 WHO health organization, after discussing and agreeing, has named this disease as
Covid-19.

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
1. The Escape

Harry slunk warily along the footpath, his head slightly bowed, eye’s darting up and down the
street, glancing every now and then left and right. His right hand hovered over the pocket in his
worn out faded jeans where his wand lay hidden, but within easy grasp. His fist was unconsciously
clenching and unclenching. Most people would have found the misty cool night air soothing,
pleasant, but Harry was on edge.
As he rounded the corner of Privet Drive, he stopped. His head turned to survey the street before
him. There was nothing out of the ordinary, but he knew someone was there, somewhere, lurking in
the darkest corners, or hidden by magic. He could feel their presence as sure as he knew he was
standing there himself. He waited for someone to show. He never knew who it would be, but he
could predict their appearance down to the last second. He stood for a moment, almost
overwhelmed by his impatience. It had been the same every night ever since he had been at his
Aunt and Uncles. And tonight, as before, a figure gradually emerged from the nothingness.
Harry was able to make out the features as it made it's way towards him. It was Kingsley
Shacklebolt. After scanning the area as soon as he had seen Harry, Kingsley had removed his
invisibility cloak and given Harry a quick nod in greeting. When they were within a few feet of each
other, Harry spoke.
‘What’s happening? Who’s here with you?’ His voice was calm, but his look was determined.
‘Goldstein is at the other end of the street’ Kingsley said in his deep voice ‘But he’ll be replaced by
Tonks at midnight. I’m on until dawn.’ Even as he spoke, he never stopped surveying the area.
‘Nothing to report?’
This is how the quick exchanges between Harry and his guard had gone every night.
‘No, nothing.’ Harry’s eye’s barely met Kingsley’s as he looked down at his shuffling feet. ‘So ...
when am I getting out of here?’
‘Nothing yet I’m afraid.’ Kingsley was used to Harry’s impatience, he had stood guard five out of the
eight nights since Harry had returned to Privet Drive. ‘Give it a bit of time,’ he said ‘things are not
as ... easy ... as they were. It’s going to take a fair bit of organizing. As it is Podmore has to leave
early ...’ he brushed his hand over his bald head ‘so I’m going to be hear alone for about half an
hour.’
Harry looked up suddenly, and then looked back at the ground just as quickly, his eyes seeming to
be searching for something. This was it! He thought. This was what he’d been waiting for. It was
only a short amount of time, he would have to cut it close, but he knew he could do it. With one
guard gone, he could slip through.
‘Is there any other news?’ Harry always dreaded asking this, but he had to know. If he was going to
go through with his plan, he had to learn everything he could about what The Order knew. There
was silence as Harry waited, eyes still lingering on the ground. He was sure if Kingsley caught his
eye, he would see the guilt Harry tried so hard to conceal. Kingsley cleared his throat.
‘Some of the usual stuff.’ he said, though he seemed hesitant. ‘A few more missing people ... they
found Fudge’s body late last night.’
Harry looked away in disgust. Fudge hadn’t been his favourite person in the world. When Harry had
returned from the graveyard, clutching Cedric Diggory’s dead body during the Triwizard Tournament
over two years ago, Fudge had refused to believe that Voldemort had taken form again. And in the
year following, he had gone to great lengths to discredit Harry in every way possible, squashing
most of Dumbledore’s efforts to get people to believe in Harry and to prepare for Lord Voldemort’s
return. But for all Fudge’s faults, he did not deserve the hand that fate had dealt him.
Harry took a deep breath and turned back to Kingsley. Somehow this news had given him the push
he needed. He now held such resolve that he was right in his plans, that he could look Shacklebolt
directly in the eyes.

- 2 -

‘What are Voldemort and his Death Eaters up to? They must have a plan! You must know something
from following the trail of blood they leave behind.’ Harry said this with such loathing that Kingsley
barely grimaced at the mention of the name Voldemort, but pulled back slightly from Harry,
seemingly more uncomfortable with his tone.
‘We don’t know ... exactly.’ Kingsley said evasively. This was the final straw for Harry, he could tell
Kingsley was reluctant to say too much, and finally the pressure of the past eight days, sitting
uselessly in his room at the Dursleys waiting for news, biding his time unable to rest as he waited
for his chance, suddenly burst to the surface.
‘If you think’ he said gravely ‘that Dumbledore didn’t know I was ready for this,’ his eyes blazed
threateningly ‘then you’ve already lost to Voldemort!’ his body was rigid with frustration.
Kingsley seemed exceedingly uncomfortable, but Harry didn’t care. If he was going to get out of
Privet Drive tonight and take on the task Dumbledore had left him to do, then he needed
information, and he needed it now. Harry had no intention of going after Voldemort yet. He had to
find and destroy all of the Horcruxes, the artefacts that contained the pieces of Voldemort’s
shattered soul, before he could do that. No, he needed information so he could avoid detection. If
he was going to do this, he was going to have to do it alone, and the last thing he needed was for
Voldemort to find out what he was up to. With the exception of Ron and Hermione, no one would
know where he was, not the Order, not Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ... not even Ginny.
‘Look,’ Kingsley said, he was fidgeting with the invisibility cloak hanging fluidly in his left hand. ‘I
don’t know what good it will do you to know too much right now anyway. You-you can’t leave until
you turn seventeen in a few weeks, it’s safer that way. You will be better protected here than
anywhere else until then, now that Dumble...’ he trailed off with an awkward hand gesture. ‘Well ...
you know what I mean.’ He gave Harry a steady look, ‘It’s what he would have wanted.’
Harry let out a heavy sigh and his body slackened slightly. He knew he could not tell Kingsley why
Dumbledore would have understood, he could not tell him about the Horcruxes, about Dumbledore’s
dying wish, so he resigned himself to returning to No 4, where he would sit and wait, now his
chance had come. Harry turned to leave, hunched over, defeated, and had only gone a few paces
when Kingsley called after him.
‘See you same time tomorrow night, then.’
Harry turned slowly and looked at Kingsley ‘Yeah,’ he said quietly ‘I’ll be here.’ A sinking feeling
crept over Harry as he turned his back on Kingsley. Would he ever see him again? Would he ever
see any of them again? He straightened himself to his full height and resumed his state of readiness
as he moved quietly back up Privet Drive.
He knew what he had to do, the path lay before him, and he would walk that path alone, as he had
done many times before.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry could see the dim glow of light seeping through the small gaps in the curtains as he reached
No.4. Someone was still awake. Harry crept up to the house and with great care, turned the handle
and pushed the door open as quietly as possible, unwilling to give his Uncle yet another opportunity
to start ranting at him, a favourite past time of his.
It seems the Dursleys had decided the best way to repay Harry for inflicting Dumbledore on them
last summer, was to make his life with them even harder for him than before. He suspected that it
had a lot to do with Dumbledore’s comment about their beloved, and hopelessly spoiled dope of a
son Dudley, who in their eyes was a perfect angel who could do no wrong.
He stepped over the threshold then eased the door back into place and released the handle, but no
sooner had he turned to mount the stairs when he saw his Uncle’s stocky figure standing in the
doorway to the kitchen, arms crossed over his rounded stomach. His eye’s glittered dangerously, as
he glared at Harry, a smug satisfaction etched on his face. He had obviously known Harry had snuck

- 3 -

out, and had been waiting there for him, ready to catch him. Harry had the impression of being like
a deer caught in the headlights of a car.
‘I knew you were up to something!’ his uncle said in quiet triumph ‘I said to Petunia you had been
sneaking around, and now ...' his eyes narrowed ‘now I’ve got you!’ his barely suppressed glee at
springing Harry was turning his face purple. ‘Where have you been boy?’ he demanded ‘Out
terrorizing the neighbours? Prowling around the streets, causing trouble no doubt!’
Harry thought this was a bit rich.
His cousin Dudley was the biggest thug in the neighbourhood, yet somehow his Aunt and Uncle had
always managed to explain away his behaviour as ‘boisterous youth’ or ‘having a bit of roguish fun’.
But Harry knew the truth; Dudley was a prat.
Uncle Vernon’s eyebrow arched high on his forehead as he approached him, his arm raised and his
finger jutting accusingly at Harry. ‘OUT WITH IT!’ he yelled sharply ‘Where have you been going
every night?’
Harry was mildly astonished that his Uncle was even interested enough in his activities to realize he
had been disappearing off on a regular basis.
A trickle of playful wickedness ran through him.
‘I’ve been reporting to my guard, actually.’ Harry said casually, watching for his Uncle’s reaction. A
deep sense of satisfaction filled Harry as he saw his uncle falter immediately, his face slackening.
Uncle Vernon choked out the word ‘G-Guard?’
‘Yes,’ said Harry ‘that’s right ...’ He paused for effect, his Uncles eyes grew wide with uncertainty
‘Guard.’ Harry finally confirmed ‘they’re posted just down the street, been there ever since I got
back from school. You’ve met some of them before ... at the station.’
Uncle Vernon looked like he had been hit with a Silencio charm. His lips were trying to form words
but no sound was coming out. Harry was enjoying himself immensely. He knew his uncle would not
have forgotten his encounter with the formidable figure of Mad-eye Moody a year ago. Harry added
with a measured tinge of exasperation ‘They insist I keep them updated with how things are while
I’m here.’ He sighed dramatically. ‘They’re quite overprotective really...’
His Uncle’s lips suddenly fused together, Harry could tell he had not been able to find a single
retort. He was looking everywhere else but at Harry, his arms dangling by his sides as he shifted his
weight uncomfortably. He finally cleared his throat.
‘You’d best get to bed.’ He mumbled without looking at Harry and then he turned and disappeared
into the kitchen without a word, Harry smirking after him.
Strictly speaking, everything Harry said was perfectly true, so he felt no guilt what so ever that he
had unhinged his Uncle. After all, it was only the fact that the Dursley’s were so unkind to him that
gave them cause to worry about his "guard" in the first place.
He headed to his room and sat on the end of his bed, Hedwig hooted softly at him from her perch
atop the cupboard. He looked up at her and smiled. She was the one thing that made being at the
Dursley's bearable.
~*~*~*~
Harry had been planning this night since he had arrived back at the Dursleys, and now that his
chance had come he felt a surge of adrenalin pulse through him. He had some last minute tasks to
do before midnight came, but almost everything he would need, lay in a state of readiness.
Mad-eye Moody had been his main obstacle, his magical eye saw right through almost everything,
including invisibility cloaks, and Harry felt sure Moody could see through the walls into his very
room at times, and on the nights Mad-eye took guard duty, he was quite certain he would not have

- 4 -

been able to slip by him.
Tonight however, Moody was not going to be a problem, and with only Kingsley on for maybe thirty
minutes, he had his chance. Harry knew the guard changed at midnight and he glanced at the
digital clock by his bed. 10.35pm, that would give him about an hour before he was to leave Privet
Drive, forever.
Harry drew in a deep breath as he leapt to his feet. Taking out some parchment and ink from his
desk draw, he sat down and started to write. As the quill scrawled across the page, Hedwig
twittered in anticipation, keen to be put to use again. She had gone out only once in the past eight
days, and that was to deliver a short, hastily written note to Ron that contained nothing of interest.
It was not safe to pass information by owl.
Ron would be back at The Burrow, trying to learn anything he could by stealthily listening in on his
father and Bill.
On the train back from Hogwarts Harry, Ron and Hermione had sat in a compartment they kept to
themselves, conceiving various tactical ways of gathering information while Ron and Hermione were
at The Burrow. Hermione had arranged to stay after spending only a week with her family. They
occasionally looked up when interrupted by Order members who were patrolling the train, or fellow
students like Neville who wandered in. But they were, for the most part, left alone. The loss of
Professor Dumbledore had imparted a sombre mood upon the Hogwarts Express.
Every time the compartment door had slid open, Harry expected - hoped, to see Ginny’s face; he
sat through the train journey back to London feeling like part of him was missing. It was the
beginning of the end of what had been for Harry the most wonderfully comforting thing he had ever
known. His heart would have liked nothing more than to have Ginny sat beside him; the smell of
her hair drifting lazily in the air and the comforting warmth of her body leaned against his. But he
knew she could not be with him, he had made that choice. She understood he had to leave her
behind. She understood he must face this challenge without her. She understood.
Harry looked at the message he had just finished writing, it was as bland as the one he had sent
Ron, but it’s purpose was far more important. He was rolling it up and sealing it when Hedwig
fluttered down from her perch and landed on the desk in front of him. She held out her leg
expectantly. Harry smiled at her affectionately and scratched her neck ‘I’m not sending it yet.’
She nibbled at his finger a little too vigorously and Harry pulled it away ‘Ow!’ he breathed laughing
softly, rubbing the red marks that she had left. She flapped her wings huffily and retreated to her
cage for a drink. ‘You’ll just have to be patient, it wont be long.’ He laid the scroll on his bed and
reached for a knapsack. He had discovered it while searching one of the closets in his room days
before; it had been bought for Dudley to take on a camping trip the Dursleys embarked on many
summers ago. It had lain discarded and forgotten ever since.
Harry bent down and lifted the loose floorboard under his bed. There lay a reasonable store of
provisions that he had managed to collect. He had been sneaking around the house in the gloom of
night using his invisibility cloak. His Aunt Petunia put the missing food down to Dudley’s inability to
stick to his diet; his cousin had frequently left traces of midnight binging strewn from one end of the
kitchen to the other.
One night, because of Dudley's veracious appetite, Harry had almost been sprung.
While heading up to his room after having just raided the pantry for supplies, Harry met Dudley
coming in the opposite direction. He had snuck out of his own room and was descending the stairs,
heading straight for Harry who was concealed under his cloak. The sheer size of Dudley meant there
wasn’t enough room for them to pass one another without Harry making significant contact with
him. Harry was holding some packets of instant porridge, dried peas and some tinned fruit in his
arms, and in his scramble to back down the stairs, he dropped a tin of apricot halves. It fell with a
loud clunk, and then to his dismay, continued to roll down the stairs, Harry's feet dodging it, as he
backed down the steps in an effort to get out of the way of Dudley.
Thunk ... thunk ... thunk was all his startled cousin heard on the stairway below him. Dudley could
see neither Harry, nor the tin of apricot halves still hidden under the cloak.

- 5 -

When Harry and the tin came to a halt at the bottom of the stairs, he looked up and saw in the
gloomy light from the street lamp outside, the look of sheer terror on his cousins bloodless, white
face. Dudley's lower lip wobbled uncontrollably as he turned, stumbling over himself in his rush to
get back to his room, inaudible squeaks escaping him as he heaved his weight against the door and
slammed it shut.
He did not venture out in the small hours of the morning again, which turned out to be very
convenient for Harry indeed.
Harry shoved some clothing and a bottle of water on top of the food he retrieved from the cavity,
and then packed several other items carefully in the outside pockets of the pack. It was now heavily
bulging as it lay on the bed. He reached in the closet for his broom, and placed it beside the scroll.
He took out the invisibility cloak from his trunk and placed it over the back of the chair, and then
lastly he packed his trunk with everything else he owned. It took him some time to check and
double check that he had packed everything; he could not afford to leave anything behind this time
as he had no intention of ever returning.
Hedwig had been watching him from her cage, her head swivelling this way and that as she followed
him round the room. She let out a small screech as Harry sat down at the desk to write one last
note.

The importance of the cultural landscape can be seen from the
different points of view: the economic benefits they can generate, the sense of belonging they have
can create and the symbolic value they claim. The cultural landscape is also very important
important because the spiritual rather than physical dimension of the person is affected
by the stimuli he perceives from his surroundings.
Similar to the natural landscape, the cultural landscape also needs to be
protected. Protection of the natural landscape is the conservation and maintenance of the form,
important components, structures and functions of the natural landscape. In there,
Conservation and maintenance of the form of the natural landscape is the activity of preserving and maintaining

The worship of animals is due to natural human curiosity.
Primitive man observed an animal with unique and inexplicable characteristics
Its likeability will appeal to human curiosity, curiosity is the result of
early man's observations of this particular feature and this wonder
eventually led to admiration. Therefore, primitive people worshiped the

Animal offerings are derived from the names of the clans, who claim to be descendants of
animals and perform worship.
Life in the mountains and forests every day is faced with animals,
Most ethnic groups often believe that wild animals such as tigers, leopards, deer, and tigers are
sacred animal, both a valuable source of food and a sacrifice, containing
supernatural powers. If worshiped, the jungler will avoid disaster

User program execution begins with one or more nested blocks
optional boot function (OB), is executed once while entering RUN mode, and
followed by one or more program cycle OBs that are executed one
cyclic way. The OB can also be associated with an interrupt event, which can be an event
standard interrupt or an error event, and execute whenever the standard or error event occurs
The corresponding error event occurs.
A function (FC) or function block (FB) is a block of program code that can be called
from an OB or from another FC or FB, down to the following levels.
FC is not associated with any part of a data block (DB), while FB
is directly attached to a DB and uses the DB to forward messages
numbers and stores temporary values ​​and results.
Size of user program, of data and of configurable
limited by available load memory and working memory in the CPU. There are no limits
for the number of blocks supported within the available working memory.
Each cycle consists of writing outputs, reading input, the execution of
user program instructions, and performing system or process maintenance
background logic. Cycle is referred to as one scan cycle or one scan.
Signal boards, signal modules and communication modules are recognized
and recorded only while the power is on.
Under the default configuration, all analog and digital I/O points are updated
updated synchronously with the scan cycle using an internal memory area
is called the process image. The process image contains a snapshot of inputs and outputs
physical output (I/O points on the CPU, on the signal board, and on the signal modules).
This cycle provides consistent logic throughout the execution of instructions
user for a given cycle and prevent flickering of the points
output, which can change state many times in the process image output area.
You can specify when numeric and analog I/O points are stored
in the progress image. If we insert a module in the device view, the data of
it is located in the progress image of the S7-1200 CPU (default). The CPU executes the change
Exchange data between the module and the progress image area automatically during the update
update of the progress image. To remove numeric or analog points from the update
automatically update the process image, we select the corresponding device in the Device configuration,
view the Properties tab, expand if necessary to set the desired I/O points, and then select
select “IO addresses/HW identifier”. Then change the entry for “Process image:”
from “Cyclic PI” to “---”. To add points back to the automatic update of the progress image,
change this selection back to “Cyclic PI”.
We can read input values ​​and write output values ​​immediately when a
execute command. An instant read will access the current state of the object input
handle and do not update the process image input region, regardless of whether a point is configured
image to be stored in the progress image. An instantaneous write to the physical output will update
Update the entire progress image output area (if a point is configured to be stored in
process image) and physical output point. We append the suffix ":P" to the I/O address if desired
The program immediately retrieves I/O data directly from the physical point instead
for using progress images.
The CPU performs a hot reboot before entering RUN mode. The
hot reboot will reset all retained memories to default boot values
specified, but keep the current values ​​stored in retained memory.
When you download a project element (such as a program block, a data block,
data or hardware configuration), the CPU performs a reboot during the switch
next to RUN mode. In addition to clearing inputs, initialize outputs and
initialize non-retainable memory, restart also activates
memory area that can be retained.
After a reboot following the download, all STOP conversions to
Sequential RUN will also perform a hot reboot (without triggering the memory
capable of holding).
The CPU supports a hot reboot to enter RUN mode. Restart
hot does not include a memory reset. All systems are not capable of keeping
and user data are both initialized at a hot reboot. Data
the user's ability to keep remains the same.
A reset memory erases all working memories, erasing possible memory areas
hold and non-hold, and copy the loaded memory to the working memory. One
memory reset does not erase diagnostic buffers or permanently stored values
of the IP address.
You can specify the CPU's power-on mode complete with the initialization method
restart using programming software. This configuration icon appears
in the Device Configuration section for the CPU in boot. When the source is
turned on, the CPU performs a sequence of power-on and system initialization diagnostic tests
system. The CPU will then go into power-on mode accordingly. Of course errors are detected
will now prevent the CPU from entering RUN mode. CPU supports power-on modes
The following.
When the operating state changes from STOP to RUN, the CPU clears the inputs
process image, initialize process image outputs, and execute startup OBs. Real
Any reads access the progress image inputs by instructions in the OBs
start will read zero value rather than the current physical input value. Therefore, to read
the current state of a physical input during boot mode, we must
perform an instant read. Start-up OBs and any associated FCs and FBs
authority will be executed next. If more than 1 startup OB exists, each of those OBs
will be executed in OB number order, in which the lowest OB number is executed
Firstly.
Each startup OB includes startup information that helps us determine validity
of the data stored and of the clock hour of the day. You can program commands n
in the startup OBs to check these startup values ​​and to perform the operation
fit. The following boot regions are supported by boot OBs.
For each scan cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the inputs, executes the program
user program, update communication modules, perform internal translation work
(housekeeping) and respond to user interrupt events and transmission requests
pine. Communication requests are processed periodically throughout the process
to scan.
These operations (except user interrupt events) are performed
regularly and in a sequential order. User interrupt events are fired
Activities will be served with priority in the order in which they appear.
The system guarantees that the scan cycle will be completed within a period of time
is called the maximum cycle time, otherwise a time error event will be generated
out.
 Each scan cycle begins by looking up the current values ​​of the outputs
digital or analog from the process image and then write them to the outputs
physical CPU, the SB and SM modules are configured for automatic I/O updates
dynamic (default configuration). When a physical output is accessed by an instruction,
both the output process image and the physical output itself are updated.
The scan cycle continues by reading the current values ​​of the digital inputs
or the like from the CPU, the SB, SM modules are configured for updating
I/O automatically (default configuration), and then writes these values ​​to the progress image
submit. When a physical input is accessed by an instruction, the value of input
The physical image is accessed, but the input process image is not updated.
 After reading the inputs, the user program is executed from the first instruction
first to the last command. This includes all chapter cycle OBs
program plus all their associated FCs and FBs. Cyclic OBs
The program is executed in order of OB number, where OB number is low
is executed first.Processing of communications occurs periodically throughout the process
scan, which can interrupt the execution of the user program.
Self-diagnostic tests include periodic checks of the system and
check the status of the I/O module.
Interrupts can occur during any part of the scan cycle, and are
event driven. When an event occurs, the CPU interrupts the scan cycle and calls OB .
configured to execute that event. After the OB finishes executing the event,
The CPU resumes the execution of the user program at the breakpoint.
OBs control the execution of the user program. Each OB must have
a unique OB number. Some default OB numbers are reversed under the value
200. Other OBs must be numbered 200 or greater.
Specific events in the CPU trigger the execution of an organization block.
OBs cannot call each other or be called from an FC or FB. There is only one event
startup, such as a diagnostic interrupt or a time interval, is possible
animate the execution of an OB. The CPU processes OBs according to their respective priority classes
them, where OBs with higher priority are processed before OBs with higher priority
lower priority. The lowest priority class is 1 (for the main program cycle), and class
highest priority is 27 (for timing error interrupts).
Program cycle OBs execute cyclically while the CPU is at
RUN mode. The main block of the program is a program cycle OB. Here
is where we put the program control instructions and also where we call blocks
additional users. Multiple program cycle OBs are allowed and allowed
executed in numerical order. OB 1 is the default. Program cycle OBs
other must be identified as OB 200 or greater.
 OBs delay execution at a specified dwell time
after an event, configured by the start interrupt command (SRT_DINT).
The delay time is specified in the input parameter of the extend instruction.
CPU processing is controlled by events. Events that trigger the
OB interrupt to be executed. The interrupt OB for an event is specified during the process
create the block, either in Device Configuration or with an ATTACH command or
DETACH. Some events occur on a background with a cycle-like system
program or cyclical events. Other events that only happen in one
short durations, like the start-up and time-delay events. Some
event occurs when there is a hardware-triggered change, such as a
threshold event on an input point or a high-speed counter event. Addition
there are events such as diagnostic error events and time error events that occur only when there is a
error. Event priorities, groups, and priorities are used to determine order
self-handling for event interrupt OBs.
Program cycle event occurs once during each program cycle
(or scan cycle). During the program cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the
entering and executing program cycle OBs. Program cycle event is required
and is always enabled. We may not have program cycle OBs, or have
Multiple OBs are selected for each program cycle event. After the cycle event
program is activated, the lowest numbered program cycle OB (usually
is OB 1) will be executed. Other program cycle OBs are executed
sequentially, in numbered order, only during the program cycle.
Cyclic interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupt at a configured interval. Configurable interval when OB
generated and selected to become a cyclic interrupt OB. Events
cyclic interrupt will interrupt the program cycle and execute the cyclic interrupt OB (event
cyclic events are in a higher priority group than program cycle events).
Only one cyclic interrupt OB can be attached to a cyclic event
submit. The CPU supports 4 cyclic interrupt events. Cyclic interrupt OBs have a
phase shift property, so execution of cyclic interrupts in cycle
The same time can be shifted from one time to another by one degree of shift
phase adjustment.
The startup event occurs once on the STOP to RUN transition and
causes the startup OB to be executed. Multiple OBs can be selected for the trigger event
motion. Startup OBs are executed in numbered order.
Time-delayed interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupts after a delay has elapsed. The delay time is determined with
SRT_DINT command. Time delay events interrupt the program cycle to execute
Time delay interrupt OB exam. Only one time delay interrupt OB is possible
attached to a time delay event. The CPU supports 4 time delay events.
Hardware interrupt events are triggered by a change in the
hard, for example a threshold tgain or threshold drop on an input point, or an event
HSC case. There can be one interrupt OB selected for each hardware interrupt event. The
Hardware events are allowed in the Device configuration section. OBs are identified
specified for an event in the Device configuration or with an ATTACH instruction in the
user program. The CPU supports several hardware interrupt events. Exact events
is based on the CPU type and number of input points.
The diagnostic error interrupt and timing error interrupt events are triggered when the CPU
detected an error. These events are in a higher priority group than events
other interrupts and can interrupt the execution of hardware interrupt delay events, periodic interrupts
program and time delay interrupt. An interrupt OB can be defined for each event
in the diagnostic and timing error interrupt events.
The number of waiting (queuing) events from a single source is limited to
using a different row for each event type. Under reaching the limit of events
wait event for a given event type, the next event will be lost.
Each CPU event has an associated priority, and the priorities are assigned
classified into priority groups. The following table summarizes the queuing depths, the
priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB
event) is approximately 210 microseconds, indicating that a program cycle OB is only
the event handler subroutine fires at the time of the interrupt event.
The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle
does not complete within the specified maximum scan cycle time.
The requested OB cannot be initialized condition occurs when an OB is
requested by a cyclic interrupt or a time delay interrupt, but the OB is
That request has just been executed.
Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type. If an event occurs
When the corresponding queue is full, a time error event is generated.
All timing error events will trigger the execution of OB 80, if any. If
OB 80 does not exist, the CPU will ignore this error. If the two dark cycle time conditions
exceeded occurs in the same program cycle without resetting the timer
then cycle, CPU will go into STOP mode, regardless of whether OB 80 exists or not.
OB 80 includes startup information that helps you determine which events and OBs have
generate error. You can program a script inside OB 80 to check initialization values
this action and to take the appropriate action. The following boot regions are supported
by OB 80:
All diagnostic error events will trigger the execution of OB 82 if it exists
in. If OB 82 does not exist, the CPU will then ignore the error. No OB 82 interrupt error
What diagnostics are present when you create a project. If desired, we add an OB 82 interrupt
Diagnostic error into the project by double clicking on “Add new block” below
“Program blocks”, then select “Organization block” and “Diagnostic error interrupt”.
OB 82 includes trigger information that helps us determine when an event is based
on the occurrence or removal of an error, and the device and channel that reported the error.
Bit 4 of IO_state indicates when the event was caused by occurrence or removal
of an error. Bit 4 will be 1 if an error is present (e.g. wire break) and 0 if error
not present.
The ladder input contains the hardware identifier (HW ID) of the device or units
function location returns an error. HW IDs are assigned automatically when components are
inserted into the device or network view and appears in the Constants tab of the recording cards
PLCs. A name is also automatically assigned to the HW ID. These entries
in the Constants tag of the PLC tags cannot be changed.
The channel number starts at 0 for the first input point (analog type
or digital) and starts at 64 for the first output point (analog or
numeric type). Various corrections are needed to distinguish the inputs from the
output in the event that the device contains both. If an error affects the complete equipment
tuning and functional units, i.e. without a source, the most significant bit of
channel number character to be set (channel number 32768).
The RE_TRIGR instruction (re-enable cycle time monitoring) allows us to
reset the timer then measure the cycle time. However, this command only works if it
is executed in an OB program cycle; RE_TRIGR command will be ignored if
is executed in OB 80. If the maximum scan cycle time is exceeded twice
in the same program cycle without RE_TRIGR instruction execution between both
twice, the CPU will then switch back to STOP immediately. The use of iterative executions
The repetition of the RE_TRIGR instruction can create an infinite loop or a very long scan cycle
long.
Usually, the scan cycle executes as fast as possible and the next scan
next starts as soon as the current scan cycle is complete. Depends on the program
user and communication tasks, the cycle time of each scan cycle can be
may vary between scan cycles. To eliminate this difference, the CPU supports a
Optional fixed minimum scan cycle time (also known as fixed scan cycle). When this optional function is activated and a scan cycle time is dark
fixed min is provided in milliseconds, CPU will maintain min cycle time
within ±1 ms for the completion of each CPU scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU completes the normal scan cycle in
time is less than the predetermined minimum scan cycle time, the CPU will use
additional scan cycle time to perform uptime diagnostics
and/or to process communication requests. In this way the CPU always takes a
fixed amount of time to complete a scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU is unable to complete the scan cycle within
Minimum cycle time is specified, the CPU will complete the scan cycle normally
normally (including communication processing) and does not generate any system response
as a result of exceeding the minimum scan time.
Load memory is a non-volatile storage area for human programs
usage, data and configuration. When a project is downloaded to the CPU, it first
stored in the load memory area. This area is placed in both a card
memory (if any) or in the CPU. This non-volatile memory is still maintained
when the power is lost. The memory card supports a larger storage space than the storage area
storage built into the CPU.
Working memory is a storage area for some elements of a human project
used while executing the user program. CPU copies a number
elements in the project from memory loaded into working memory. Variable Memory
This is lost when power is lost, and it is stored by the CPU when power is restored
restore.
Retained memory is a non-volatile storage area for a limited number of
limit working memory values. Retained memory area used for storage
values ​​of user-selected memory locations during
sourceless space. When the power is turned on again, the CPU has enough time to hold on
to maintain the values ​​of a limited number of special memory locations. The prices
This retained value is then restored when the power is turned on.
Bit memory (M): we can determine the exact width of memory for each tuple
Remember the bit in the PLC tag table or in the assignment list. Storage bit memory
always starts at MB0 and runs up successively to a specified number of
bytes. We determine this value from the PLC tag table or from the assignment list by
clicking on the “Retain” icon. Enter the number of bytes M to hold
start again at MB0.
Tags in a function block (FB): if a function block is created with box
“Symbolic access only” is selected, the editor interface for this FB then
will contain a column “Retain”. In this column, you can choose both “Retain” or
“Non-retain” separately for each record tag. An Instant DB has been created
output when this FB is placed in the editor will show this retain column, but
for display purposes only; We cannot change the save state from within the program

“Symbolic access only”.
If a FB was created with the “Symbolic access only” box unchecked,
This theme editor for FB will not include a “Retain” column. An Instant DB
was created when this FB was inserted in the editor the program will show
see an editable “Retain” column. In this case, choosing option
“Retain” for any tag will result in all tags selected.
Similarly, canceling the option selection for any tag will result in
All recording cards are deselected. For a configured FB that is not
“Symbolic access only”, we have tTo change the retention state from within the submission scope

After creating FB, one cannot change the option for “Symbolic access

an existing FB configured for “Symbolic access only”, right click on FB
In the Project tree, select “Properties”, and then select “Attributes”.
A total of 2048 bytes of data can be held. To see how many bytes, word

although this is where the retention ranges are defined for M.
The CPU supports a diagnostic buffer containing one entry per event
diagnose. Each entry includes the date and time the event occurred, a list of
event entry and an event description. The entries are displayed in order
time with the most recent event at the top. While the CPU maintains power, there is
The most recent 50 events are in this log. When the log is full, a new event will
replace the longest occurring event in the log. When the source is lost, 10 recent events
will be saved.
The CPU supports one hour of the day clock. A large capacitor provides power
amount required to keep the clock running for the duration that the CPU is powered off. Capacitors
This power is charged while the CPU is powered up. Arrive at least 2 hours after the CPU has
powered off, this large capacitor will be fully charged to keep the meter running for
Usually about 10 days.
Time of Day Clock is set according to the system time which is time
Coordinate Universal Time (UTC). There are commands to read system time
system (RD_SYS_T) or local time (RD_LOC_T). Local time is calculated in
how to use time zone and daylight saving correction that we set in
Device configuration section CPU Clock section.
We configure the hour of day clock for the CPU under the “Time of .” property
day". You can also activate daylight saving time and define the times
start and stop points for daylight saving time. To set up copper
hour of the day, you must be online and in the “Online &
Diagnostics” of the CPU. Use the “Set time of day” function.
The CPU initializes these bytes on the transition from STOP mode to mode
STARTUP. The bits of the timer memory change synchronously to the clock
CPU throughout STARTUP and RUN modes.
Each level allows known functions to be accessible without
a password. The default condition for the CPU is to have no restrictions and no
there is a password protection. To limit access to a CPU, we configure
Display the CPU properties and enter the password.
Entering a password over a network will not reduce the value of the password
password protection for the CPU. A password protected CPU allows only
unrestricted access to one user at a time. Secret protection
The password does not apply to the execution of the user program script including
communication functions. Entering the correct password will provide access to all
all functions.
PLC to PLC communication (using communication instruction set in code blocks)
is not restricted by the security level in the CPU. The HMI function is also not affected
limit.
STEP 7 Basic software facilitates symbolic programming. Pine
Usually, tags are created both in the PLC tag, in a data block, or in
interface at the top of an OB, FC or FB. These tags include name, data type,
data, corrections and legends. In addition, in a data block, an initial value has
can be established. You can use these tags when programming by entering
tag name in command parameter. Optionally, we can also enter the operand
independent (memory, device, size and offset) at the instruction parameter. Examples in
The following shows how to enter absolute operands. The % character is spelled
dynamically inserted before the absolute operand by the program editor. I can flip
change the view mode in the program editor to one of the following:
symbol (Symbolic), symbol and absolute (Symbolic and absolute) or absolute
(Absolute).
By adding “:P” to an address, we can immediately read the
to the digital or analog type of the CPU, SB, or SM. The difference between a retrieval
using I_:P instead of using I is that the data will come directly from the points
being accessed rather than from the input process image. Retrieve the referenced I_:P
to an “immediate read” access because the data is retrieved immediately from the source
rather than from a copy that was made the last time the input progress image
updated.
Since the physical input points receive their data directly from the field devices are connected to these points, writing to these points is prohibited.
That is to say, I_:P accesses are read-only, as opposed to I-accessibles
read or write.
I_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the possible inputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the inputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at I4.0, then
The input points can be accessed by addresses I4.0:P and I4.1:P or by IB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from I4.2:P through I4.7:P are not denied, but are not
are recognized, since these points are not used. Accesses to the IW4:P . address
and ID4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with the SB.
Since the physical output points directly control the connected field devices
to these points, reading from these points is prohibited. That means, the
Q_:P outputs are write-only, as opposed to Q accesses which can be read or written.
Q_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the outputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the outputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at Q4.0, then
Output points can be accessed by address Q4.0:P and Q4.1:P or by QB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from Q4.2:P to Q4.7:P are not denied, but
are not recognized, as these points are not used. Accesses to address
QW4:P and QD4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with SB.
Data types are used to specify the size of a data element
data as well as the manner in which the data is interpreted. Each command parameter supports at least
one data type, and some parameters also support multiple data types. We keep the pointer over
the parameter field of a command to see what data types are supported for a message
given number.
A formal parameter is an identifier on an instruction that marks the location of data
data used by that instruction (e.g. the IN1 input of an ADD instruction). Actual parameters
is actually a memory location or constant containing data used for an instruction (eg %MD400
“Number_of_Widgets”). The data type of the actual parameter is specified by the user
must match one of the official spec's supported data types
specified by the command.
When specifying an actual parameter, you must specify either a tag (symbol) or
an absolute memory address. Tags associated with a symbol name (tag name)
with a data type, a device, memory offset, and comment line, and can
created either in the PLC tag editor or in the Interface editor
for a block (OB, FC, FB or DB). If entering an absolute address without
tag related, one must use an appropriate size for the data type
supported, and a default tag will be created under the entry.
You can also enter constant values ​​for multiple input parameters. The following table
This describes the basic data types supported, including examples of fixed entry.
All types except String are available in the PLC tag editor
and in the block's Interface editor. The String type is only available in the editor
Draft the interface of the block. The following table defines the basic data types.
Real numbers (or floating point numbers) are displayed as numbers with precision
32-bit single-precision (Real) or 64-bit double-precision number (LReal) as described in
ANSI/IEEE 754-1985 standard. Single precision floating point numbers
accurate to up to 6 significant digits and double precision floating point numbers
is accurate to up to 15 significant digits. You can specify up to 6 significant digits
(Real type) or 15 significant digits (LReal) when entering a floating point constant
to maintain accuracy.
Calculations involving a long sequence of values ​​consisting of very large numbers or
very small can produce inaccurate results. This can occur if the numbers
less than 10 to the power of x, where x > 6 (Real type) or x > 15 (LReal type).
Example for Real: 100 000 000 + 1 = 100 000 000.
CPU supports String data type for storing a sequence of single byte characters
odd. The String data type contains a total character counter (the number of characters in the string) and
current character counter. String type provides up to 256 bytes for storing results
maximum total character count (1 byte), current character count result (1 byte) and max
254 characters, where each character is stored in 1 byte.
We can use orthogonal strings (constants) for command parameters of type
IN using single quotes. For example, a 3-character string 'ABC' might
is used as input to the IN parameter of the S_CONV instruction. You can also create string variables by selecting the data type “String” in the interface editor
blocks for OB, FC, FB and DB. You cannot create a string in the tag editor
take noteof PLCs. You can specify the maximum string size in bytes when declaring
string, for example, “MyString[10]” will specify a maximum size of 10 bytes for MyString.
If the square brackets are not included with the maximum size indicator, the value 254 will
Send.
The following example defines a string with a maximum character count of 10 and the value
current character count equals 3. This means that currently the string contains 3 1 byte characters,The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times. However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.
• Malaysia's model of enforcement agency (Pemandu)
Background: In 2009, the Malaysian government faced a series of dilemmas similar to many other developing countries, such as the middle-income trap, budget deficit ratio, and public debt ratio. is very large, the crime and corruption rate is high, the labor productivity is stagnant, the bureaucracy of the public administration is clearly revealed, from which people gradually lose confidence in the management process of the Government. government, losing faith in the promise that by 2020, Malaysia will become a high-income country. Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times. However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.

These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected.

The results of the study of countries with top education indicate that Vietnam is lacking in policies of a comprehensive and comprehensive scale; should enhance the sense of responsibility of teachers in the work of "growing people". With the addition of many programs to teach skills and orientation for future preschoolers at the high school level, the competitiveness in the educational environment is higher than that of cooperation, which is also a shortcoming. Vietnam can consult as well as learn from the experiences of Denmark and Finland - two countries with the most advanced and quality education in the world.Vietnam's global competitiveness
 The target to attract foreign investment into Vietnam by 2030 is from 40-50 billion USD/year in registered capital, and 30-40 billion USD/year in realized capital, this goal is being implemented according to Resolution 50 deals with a number of hot issues to attract investment and prioritize reforms to improve competitiveness. The issue of improving the country's competitiveness has been consistently mentioned in the guidelines and policies of the Party; legal policy of the State. After more than 30 years of renovation, Vietnam's competitive competence has changed and improved gradually, but compared to the world and even the ASEAN region, it is still low. In 10 years (2007 - 2017), Vietnam's global competitiveness has improved from 70 - 75 to 55 - 60. Vietnam has moved from the bottom half to the top half of the global competitiveness rankings. If only in 5 years (2012 - 2017), the global competitiveness of Vietnam's economy tends to improve clearly, from 75th place in 2012 to 55th in 2017. From 2018, according to the index calculation method. GCI 4.0, Vietnam's competitive competence Vietnam has dropped 3 places (from 74th position to 77th position), but the absolute score has improved by 0.2 points with 4/12 pillars gaining points. This has shown that Vietnam has improved in Global Competitiveness 4.0, but it is still slow and unsustainable. Among the pillars with improved points, the pillar with the most improved points is Labor market efficiency from 52.4 points to 55.6 points (up 3.2 points); followed by the level of information technology application from 41.9 points to 43.3 points (up 1.4 points); Market size expanded with an increase from 69.8 points to 70.9 points (up 1.1 points); and Health from 80.3 points to 81 points (up 0.7 points). The score of the pillar of macroeconomic stability has not changed compared to 2017. However, besides remarkable achievements, Vietnam's global competitiveness still has many limitations. Vietnam's global competitiveness ranking is currently only at a good average level in the international arena.Construction permits can be obtained at the same time as the construction process. At the same time, Indonesia also allows quick clearance of input goods for construction activities of investment projects, the clearance time is reduced from 3-5 days to 30 minutes.
• One-stop model through Urban Transformation Center (UTC) Malaysia
The activities of UTCs in Malaysia have been very successful in implementing activities that adhere to the people-centered principle. First of all, it's that the services offered at UTC are so diverse, people just need to know one place to meet all their needs. Communities can also perform many transactions with the Government and private establishments in one building conveniently and quickly without having to travel to many places as before. The establishment of a catalog of services offered at UTC is the result of extensive public consultation, which services the public needs most, which are included in the UTCs. In addition to public administrative services, UTCs also extend to provide many services to serve people's lives, such as education and employment services; public utility services such as electricity and water; security services; community development and welfare services; services of NGO groups working to influence local communities; business development services, start-ups, organize training courses for startups and business development; medical services, including outpatient and dental services; financial services, bank kiosks for people to transact; youth services such as gym, game room... These services are subject to change and may not be provided at UTC anymore if people have low demand or cannot guarantee the quality of service. Starting from the point of view of public convenience, quick implementation time and lowest implementation cost, Malaysia's UTCs were repaired and converted from existing buildings. there are unused or low utilization rates such as old bus stations, shopping malls, business shops. To date, these solutions have met the set goals. The model of UTCs is highly appreciated by the people in both utility and service quality, creating a familiar UTC brand for every Malaysian citizen. This model has received the highest award from the Prime Minister of Malaysia and UTCs are continuously improving to continue to receive recognition from both the public and private sides. Across the territory of Malaysia, there are currently 21 UTCs formed.
Lessons and applicability to Vietnam: In Vietnam, at present, provinces and cities are tending to establish public administrative centers to focus on receiving administrative dossiers of agencies. This is a right direction, in line with the principle of taking people and businesses as the center as analyzed above and it is necessary to speed up the implementation progress, so that people can enjoy the utilities as soon as possible and just come to them. a place to carry out administrative procedures and that will be the place to provide many services to the people. In addition, Vietnam also needs to accelerate the completion of shared databases and promote propaganda and communication about the National Public Service Portal to effectively serve the people, protect the public and protect the public. ensure the easiest and most convenient access. In addition, improving the quality of the implementation of the OSS mechanism in serving citizens needs to be through the effective implementation of the Decree on the implementation of the OSS mechanism in handling administrative procedures. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish and effectively operate public administrative service centers, improve the quality of administrative procedures through transparency in administrative procedure information and transparency in the implementation process. and ensure that the assessment is carried out substantively and that the evaluation results are treated seriously.
• Malaysia's model of enforcement agency (Pemandu)
Background: In 2009, the Malaysian government faced a series of dilemmas similar to many other developing countries, such as the middle-income trap, budget deficit ratio, and public debt ratio. is very large, the crime and corruption rate is high, the labor productivity is stagnant, the bureaucracy of the public administration is clearly revealed, from which people gradually lose confidence in the management process of the Government. government, losing faith in the promise that by 2020, Malaysia will become a high-income country. Facing that situation, Malaysia started implementing a national transformation program (NTP), including two programs, government transformation (GTP) and economic transformation (ETP), which PEMANDU is in charge of.Preliminary assessment of applicability in Vietnam: The initiatives in Malaysia's national transformation program have many similarities with what Vietnam has been trying to do, such as the Advisory Council for Improvement. administrative procedures of the Prime Minister of Vietnam have the same organization, operation and tasks as PEMANDU. However, administrative reform, socio-economic reform, and implementation of tasks are still slow, and the quality of implementation is not guaranteed, so the efficiency is not high.
• Model to increase the efficiency of the process of customs clearance of goods across the border: The US Customs Clearance Guarantee
A Clearance Guarantee is a legal agreement that ensures all necessary duties, taxes, and fees are paid to Customs when importing commercial goods, for shipments valued at more than $2,500. Certain situations require the use of a customs clearance guarantee to import goods, such as the importation for commercial purposes and the import of specific goods that require specialized inspection. Conditions for applying the clearance guarantee: To import goods using the clearance guarantee, investors need to meet 8 conditions: Agree to pay the right taxes, duties and other fees the deadline, agree to enter the country, agree to provide all relevant documents, agree to send the goods back if necessary, agree to fix problems that are not in accordance with the input regulations, agree to allow the goods to be inspected import, agree to pay any necessary inspection, handling and storage fees, agree to comply with the rules of duty-free shipments preliminary assessment of applicability to Vietnam: Implementation Customs guarantee is now more efficient and less costly than bank guarantee. Import-export companies will buy guarantees from private insurers but the beneficiary will be the state (customs authority): if in case the importer fails to perform or does not fully perform the Tax obligations and goods quality assurance according to specialized inspection, the insurance company will guarantee for the payable tax and/or fines for violations. This is a typical feature of customs guarantee systems around the world and is why it has become so popular and is required to be implemented in international treaties (e.g. WTO TFA) and free trade agreements: guaranteeing customs clearance facilitation GCI 4.0 REPORT | 22 for the international sale of goods but does not pose a risk to the state budget and compliance with product quality.Vietnam's accession to ASEAN will bring Vietnam many great opportunities to expand markets, expand exports, attract investment sources, etc. However, opportunities always go hand in hand with great challenges such as: The competitiveness of enterprises is weak, energy and labor quality is low, tariff and non-tariff barriers between countries will be gradually eliminated, Vietnam's exports will face competition from countries. It requires businesses to seize opportunities, actively change production technologies to more advanced to create products of good quality, at affordable prices, with product prices that can compete with many competitors. High quality products of countries on the market.
Vietnam is in the process of economic integration and development, so strong competitiveness is extremely important. To achieve development and high competitiveness, the work of finding a solution is the first problem. The state needs to have policy tools to create conditions for companies and businesses to have capital so that they can invest in improving infrastructure, equipment, and machinery, and the state needs to focus on training high quality human resources. The State needs to guide to carry out improvements in administrative reform, business environment, investment and services to improve international competitiveness.The Index of Time to Start a Business (11.02): First analyzing the results of the time to start a business from 2007-2019 shows that the number of days has been reduced quite a lot in recent times. However, the reduction level is not significant compared to other countries in the world. In order to improve the hierarchy, Vietnam needs to take further breakthrough measures and policies in implementing the business registration and invoice registration processes. In order to achieve the goals of increasing 20-25 places in the Doing Business ranking (according to Resolution 02/2019), we need to triple our efforts compared to the initial set to reduce the number of days to start a business. down to a maximum of 5 days and 4 steps, now 17 days (Doing Business 2019). In 2020, the Government issued Decree No. 122/2020/ND-CP on coordination and communication between state management agencies in handling procedures for registration of business establishment and registration of branch operations. , representative office of the enterprise, declare the use of labor and issue a code of the unit participating in social insurance, register for the use of invoices. The decision to implement Decree 122 is estimated to help Vietnam reduce an additional 2 to 3 days in the implementation of administrative procedures for starting a business. However, Vietnam still has to improve the procedure for registering to use invoices (10 days) to shorten the implementation time as much as possible. The country with the shortest time is only 0.5 days and 1 step.According to the group of indicators of Bankruptcy in enterprises (11.03 Recovery rate when enterprises fall into bankruptcy, 11.04 Legal framework to solve problems of corporate bankruptcy): the above information shows that The Enterprise Bankruptcy Index is a "minus point" of Vietnam's business environment. Up to now, these indicators have not shown any signs of improvement, even going down in the Doing Business Ranking (133/190 economies), even lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). In Vietnam, the regulations are mainly about resolving bankruptcy proceedings, not much attention to the level of business and production recovery of enterprises, which provides an important criterion in the process of bankruptcy. GCI and it accounts for 50% of the score in Doing Business. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is hardly resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. The main cause of this situation lies in both the courts and the judgment enforcement agencies. Over the past time, the Supreme People's Court has had many policies to reform the legal document system on civil procedure, but there are still quite a few reforms on paper. In fact, if judicial institutions are not effective and serious about remedial action, then amending the law is not very effective. A study shows that, in transition economies such as Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries in the period 1992-1998, it proves that the amendment of the corporate law and the bankruptcy law did not have much impact on the institutions. finance. Laws can only really have an impact when judicial institutions are more effective. According to Resolution 02/2019, the index
Enterprise bankruptcy is set to be raised by 10 -15 steps; 2019 has increased at least 3 places. Therefore, according to the WB's recommendation, strengthening the rule of law and the effectiveness of the courts is an issue that needs to be prioritized and resolved in the coming time.
Besides, Vietnam also needs to change its approach to private enterprise management. And reduce the level of unpredictability in the process of implementing regulations, strengthen the protection of property rights, and apply risk management principles in the implementation of bankruptcy laws, according to the World Bank - Vietnam 2030.According to the information, the index group of Willingness to Authorize (11.05), and Attitudes to Risk in Business (11.06) and Growth of Innovative Companies (11.07): Culture in Business These are the weak points of Vietnamese enterprises in the process of international integration. In the business culture of the Vietnamese people, there are many old, outdated and arbitrary habits and ways of doing business that still exist; On the contrary, the professional, creative and willing working style has not been clearly defined; as well as many limitations on the aspirational vision of Vietnamese businesses and entrepreneurs 20. The State's recommendation on a new economic model for Vietnam in the period 2021-2030 shows that Vietnam needs to make efforts. and more actively to create breakthrough achievements in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship can ensure success in the future 21.Corporate Bankruptcy: Corporate Bankruptcy is the component index with the lowest scores of the component indexes. Even in the Doing Business23 report, this index is always at the bottom of the rankings, lower than most ASEAN countries (just above Laos). After many years, Corporate Bankruptcy not only showed no signs of improvement, but also went down in the rankings. One of the reasons why this index is so low is that Vietnam's regulations are mainly on resolving bankruptcy procedures without paying attention to the level of production and business recovery of enterprises. is an important criterion in GCI 4.0 and accounts for 50% of the scores in the Doing Business component index. Besides, the Bankruptcy Law has many limitations, the bankruptcy of enterprises is not resolved quickly; the quality of legal provisions on bankruptcy settlement is still low. In fact, if the judicial institutions are not effective, the amendment of the law will not bring about a positive effect.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career. These skills will gradually show their importance as Vietnam's population is aging and manufacturing operations become more and more technically complex, which requires workers to keep up with the latest trends. advancement of technology throughout the working life. The World Bank's Vietnam Development Report 2014 pointed out that the strategy is to build a cognitive and behavioral foundation in general education and develop job-appropriate technical skills through the education system. Job creation and university are better connected. According to Resolution 02/2019, the ranking of indicators of the "Human Resources" group needs to increase by 10-15 steps, in 2019 alone, it must increase by 3-5 steps. Government has an important role to play in empowering, investing, and facilitating connections among students, universities, educational institutions, and businesses. To do that, the Ministry of Education and Training needs to focus on renovating the curriculum and teaching methods to be more appropriate in order to help Vietnamese students become people who know how to solve problems. topics, think critically, exchange, communicate and work better together, and associate education with career orientation and practice right from the high school level.
Group of indicators on “Quality of vocational training” (6.03), “Digital skills of people” (6.05) and “Ease of finding skilled workers” (6.06): According to WEF 2018, through survey One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report. According to the WB's recommendation, the new economic model for Vietnam in the period of 2021-2030 to ensure its growth, Vietnam needs to increase the productivity of human resources. One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.
In the future, workers will also need to be equipped with higher skills to help them respond to changes in labor market demand. Although the country's education system has made undeniable achievements in providing basic skills, at present, Vietnam faces greater challenges in terms of training advanced skills due to consequences of technological progress. According to Resolution 02/2019, the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is the state agency tasked with raising the ranking on the index of “Vocational training quality” (B6) to 20-25 places, and at least 5 places up in 2019.One of the top 5 problems in doing business in Vietnam is an inadequately trained workforce and poor work ethics. The weaknesses of the labor force in our country have been pointed out before in the World Bank's 2014 Development Report.

One of the three areas where new progress should be made is the development of human capital, in which improving the quality of the labor force is one of the prerequisites to bring about increased productivity.

If Vietnam wants to improve the quality of its labor force, it needs to have appropriate modern labor market policies to respond to changes in demand in the labor market. These policies need to be systematic, protect the rights of workers, as well as improve the quality of the labor force. Vietnam should also refer to the policies of other advanced countries such as Switzerland and Germany, these are the two best countries in the world in vocational training, on-the-job training, and graduate employment. business. In addition, Switzerland is also a typical example of an efficient labor market, with a high capacity to adapt to technology 4.0 of the workforce.Good cognitive and behavioral skills will help employees improve their skills throughout their career.

priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB

The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle

Cultural perspective is an inseparable and structured mundane space
contains natural and cultural elements.
The importance of the cultural landscape can be seen from the
different points of view: the economic benefits they can generate, the sense of belonging they have
can create and the symbolic value they claim. The cultural landscape is also very important
important because the spiritual rather than physical dimension of the person is affected
by the stimuli he perceives from his surroundings.
Similar to the natural landscape, the cultural landscape also needs to be
protected. Protection of the natural landscape is the conservation and maintenance of the form,
important components, structures and functions of the natural landscape. In there,
Conservation and maintenance of the form of the natural landscape is the activity of preserving and maintaining

In sociology, the concept of socialization is defined as
a cycle that introduces you to social norms and common customs
through social interaction. To help people develop their abilities
own and learn from society. In other words, socialization is their journey
We continuously absorb culture into our personality to live in harmony with society.
Socialization is an important foundation of human beings, unlike other creatures
On the other hand, people need to have social understanding to live. In addition to the substantial existence
Simply biological, social experience creates the personality of each person. Understand
In a simple sense, personality is a system of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that
organization in which people think and perceive the world and themselves
such as reactions and actions in social interactions.

Socialization is not only important to an individual's life, it helps to
society is continuously developing, has a history, has a present and has a future. Experience
society always exists in society, every society teaches new members about it
and the process goes on continuously from generation to generation, spanning the life of
an individual. Besides the propaganda about the values ​​and civilized way of life of the ceremony
associations and religious activities. We need to strengthen the inspection, inspection,
seriously handle violations in the field of festival management and organization, take measures to
measures to promptly prevent negative manifestations.
Along with that, the Department of Information and Communications; active media units
propagate widely to all classes of people about the regulations on management and organization
festival; Timely praise localities and individuals for their good practice of cultural life
demonstrating in festival activities as well as criticizing violations of relevant regulations
regarding the celebration of the festival.
The worship of animals is due to natural human curiosity.
Primitive man observed an animal with unique and inexplicable characteristics
Its likeability will appeal to human curiosity, curiosity is the result of
early man's observations of this particular feature and this wonder
eventually led to admiration. Therefore, primitive people worshiped the
Animals have inimitable characteristics. Other authors argue that worshiping
Animal offerings are derived from the names of the clans, who claim to be descendants of
animals and perform worship.
Life in the mountains and forests every day is faced with animals,
Most ethnic groups often believe that wild animals such as tigers, leopards, deer, and tigers are
sacred animal, both a valuable source of food and a sacrifice, containing
supernatural powers. If worshiped, the jungler will avoid disaster
when exploiting natural products, and as having more power. Apart from animals
In the forest, domestic animals such as buffaloes, cows, pigs, and chickens are said to be
animals with souls.
Therefore, animal worship is a very special belief of people

User program execution begins with one or more nested blocks
optional boot function (OB), is executed once while entering RUN mode, and
followed by one or more program cycle OBs that are executed one
cyclic way. The OB can also be associated with an interrupt event, which can be an event
standard interrupt or an error event, and execute whenever the standard or error event occurs
The corresponding error event occurs.
A function (FC) or function block (FB) is a block of program code that can be called
from an OB or from another FC or FB, down to the following levels.
FC is not associated with any part of a data block (DB), while FB
is directly attached to a DB and uses the DB to forward messages
numbers and stores temporary values ​​and results.
Size of user program, of data and of configurable
limited by available load memory and working memory in the CPU. There are no limits
for the number of blocks supported within the available working memory.
Each cycle consists of writing outputs, reading input, the execution of
user program instructions, and performing system or process maintenance
background logic. Cycle is referred to as one scan cycle or one scan.
Signal boards, signal modules and communication modules are recognized
and recorded only while the power is on.
Under the default configuration, all analog and digital I/O points are updated
updated synchronously with the scan cycle using an internal memory area
is called the process image. The process image contains a snapshot of inputs and outputs
physical output (I/O points on the CPU, on the signal board, and on the signal modules).
This cycle provides consistent logic throughout the execution of instructions
user for a given cycle and prevent flickering of the points
output, which can change state many times in the process image output area.
You can specify when numeric and analog I/O points are stored
in the progress image. If we insert a module in the device view, the data of
it is located in the progress image of the S7-1200 CPU (default). The CPU executes the change
Exchange data between the module and the progress image area automatically during the update
update of the progress image. To remove numeric or analog points from the update
automatically update the process image, we select the corresponding device in the Device configuration,
view the Properties tab, expand if necessary to set the desired I/O points, and then select
select “IO addresses/HW identifier”. Then change the entry for “Process image:”
from “Cyclic PI” to “---”. To add points back to the automatic update of the progress image,
change this selection back to “Cyclic PI”.
We can read input values ​​and write output values ​​immediately when a
execute command. An instant read will access the current state of the object input
handle and do not update the process image input region, regardless of whether a point is configured
image to be stored in the progress image. An instantaneous write to the physical output will update
Update the entire progress image output area (if a point is configured to be stored in
process image) and physical output point. We append the suffix ":P" to the I/O address if desired
The program immediately retrieves I/O data directly from the physical point instead
for using progress images.
The CPU performs a hot reboot before entering RUN mode. The
hot reboot will reset all retained memories to default boot values
specified, but keep the current values ​​stored in retained memory.
When you download a project element (such as a program block, a data block,
data or hardware configuration), the CPU performs a reboot during the switch
next to RUN mode. In addition to clearing inputs, initialize outputs and
initialize non-retainable memory, restart also activates
memory area that can be retained.
After a reboot following the download, all STOP conversions to
Sequential RUN will also perform a hot reboot (without triggering the memory
capable of holding).
The CPU supports a hot reboot to enter RUN mode. Restart
hot does not include a memory reset. All systems are not capable of keeping
and user data are both initialized at a hot reboot. Data
the user's ability to keep remains the same.
A reset memory erases all working memories, erasing possible memory areas
hold and non-hold, and copy the loaded memory to the working memory. One
memory reset does not erase diagnostic buffers or permanently stored values
of the IP address.
You can specify the CPU's power-on mode complete with the initialization method
restart using programming software. This configuration icon appears
in the Device Configuration section for the CPU in boot. When the source is
turned on, the CPU performs a sequence of power-on and system initialization diagnostic tests
system. The CPU will then go into power-on mode accordingly. Of course errors are detected
will now prevent the CPU from entering RUN mode. CPU supports power-on modes
The following.
When the operating state changes from STOP to RUN, the CPU clears the inputs
process image, initialize process image outputs, and execute startup OBs. Real
Any reads access the progress image inputs by instructions in the OBs
start will read zero value rather than the current physical input value. Therefore, to read
the current state of a physical input during boot mode, we must
perform an instant read. Start-up OBs and any associated FCs and FBs
authority will be executed next. If more than 1 startup OB exists, each of those OBs
will be executed in OB number order, in which the lowest OB number is executed
Firstly.
Each startup OB includes startup information that helps us determine validity
of the data stored and of the clock hour of the day. You can program commands n
in the startup OBs to check these startup values ​​and to perform the operation
fit. The following boot regions are supported by boot OBs.
For each scan cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the inputs, executes the program
user program, update communication modules, perform internal translation work
(housekeeping) and respond to user interrupt events and transmission requests
pine. Communication requests are processed periodically throughout the process
to scan.
These operations (except user interrupt events) are performed
regularly and in a sequential order. User interrupt events are fired
Activities will be served with priority in the order in which they appear.
The system guarantees that the scan cycle will be completed within a period of time
is called the maximum cycle time, otherwise a time error event will be generated
out.
 Each scan cycle begins by looking up the current values ​​of the outputs
digital or analog from the process image and then write them to the outputs
physical CPU, the SB and SM modules are configured for automatic I/O updates
dynamic (default configuration). When a physical output is accessed by an instruction,
both the output process image and the physical output itself are updated.
The scan cycle continues by reading the current values ​​of the digital inputs
or the like from the CPU, the SB, SM modules are configured for updating
I/O automatically (default configuration), and then writes these values ​​to the progress image
submit. When a physical input is accessed by an instruction, the value of input
The physical image is accessed, but the input process image is not updated.
 After reading the inputs, the user program is executed from the first instruction
first to the last command. This includes all chapter cycle OBs
program plus all their associated FCs and FBs. Cyclic OBs
The program is executed in order of OB number, where OB number is low
is executed first.Processing of communications occurs periodically throughout the process
scan, which can interrupt the execution of the user program.
Self-diagnostic tests include periodic checks of the system and
check the status of the I/O module.
Interrupts can occur during any part of the scan cycle, and are
event driven. When an event occurs, the CPU interrupts the scan cycle and calls OB .
configured to execute that event. After the OB finishes executing the event,
The CPU resumes the execution of the user program at the breakpoint.
OBs control the execution of the user program. Each OB must have
a unique OB number. Some default OB numbers are reversed under the value
200. Other OBs must be numbered 200 or greater.
Specific events in the CPU trigger the execution of an organization block.
OBs cannot call each other or be called from an FC or FB. There is only one event
startup, such as a diagnostic interrupt or a time interval, is possible
animate the execution of an OB. The CPU processes OBs according to their respective priority classes
them, where OBs with higher priority are processed before OBs with higher priority
lower priority. The lowest priority class is 1 (for the main program cycle), and class
highest priority is 27 (for timing error interrupts).
Program cycle OBs execute cyclically while the CPU is at
RUN mode. The main block of the program is a program cycle OB. Here
is where we put the program control instructions and also where we call blocks
additional users. Multiple program cycle OBs are allowed and allowed
executed in numerical order. OB 1 is the default. Program cycle OBs
other must be identified as OB 200 or greater.
 OBs delay execution at a specified dwell time
after an event, configured by the start interrupt command (SRT_DINT).
The delay time is specified in the input parameter of the extend instruction.
CPU processing is controlled by events. Events that trigger the
OB interrupt to be executed. The interrupt OB for an event is specified during the process
create the block, either in Device Configuration or with an ATTACH command or
DETACH. Some events occur on a background with a cycle-like system
program or cyclical events. Other events that only happen in one
short durations, like the start-up and time-delay events. Some
event occurs when there is a hardware-triggered change, such as a
threshold event on an input point or a high-speed counter event. Addition
there are events such as diagnostic error events and time error events that occur only when there is a
error. Event priorities, groups, and priorities are used to determine order
self-handling for event interrupt OBs.
Program cycle event occurs once during each program cycle
(or scan cycle). During the program cycle, the CPU writes the outputs, reads the
entering and executing program cycle OBs. Program cycle event is required
and is always enabled. We may not have program cycle OBs, or have
Multiple OBs are selected for each program cycle event. After the cycle event
program is activated, the lowest numbered program cycle OB (usually
is OB 1) will be executed. Other program cycle OBs are executed
sequentially, in numbered order, only during the program cycle.
Cyclic interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupt at a configured interval. Configurable interval when OB
generated and selected to become a cyclic interrupt OB. Events
cyclic interrupt will interrupt the program cycle and execute the cyclic interrupt OB (event
cyclic events are in a higher priority group than program cycle events).
Only one cyclic interrupt OB can be attached to a cyclic event
submit. The CPU supports 4 cyclic interrupt events. Cyclic interrupt OBs have a
phase shift property, so execution of cyclic interrupts in cycle
The same time can be shifted from one time to another by one degree of shift
phase adjustment.
The startup event occurs once on the STOP to RUN transition and
causes the startup OB to be executed. Multiple OBs can be selected for the trigger event
motion. Startup OBs are executed in numbered order.
Time-delayed interrupt events allow you to configure the execution of an OB .
interrupts after a delay has elapsed. The delay time is determined with
SRT_DINT command. Time delay events interrupt the program cycle to execute
Time delay interrupt OB exam. Only one time delay interrupt OB is possible
attached to a time delay event. The CPU supports 4 time delay events.
Hardware interrupt events are triggered by a change in the
hard, for example a threshold tgain or threshold drop on an input point, or an event
HSC case. There can be one interrupt OB selected for each hardware interrupt event. The
Hardware events are allowed in the Device configuration section. OBs are identified
specified for an event in the Device configuration or with an ATTACH instruction in the
user program. The CPU supports several hardware interrupt events. Exact events
is based on the CPU type and number of input points.
The diagnostic error interrupt and timing error interrupt events are triggered when the CPU
detected an error. These events are in a higher priority group than events
other interrupts and can interrupt the execution of hardware interrupt delay events, periodic interrupts
program and time delay interrupt. An interrupt OB can be defined for each event
in the diagnostic and timing error interrupt events.
The number of waiting (queuing) events from a single source is limited to
using a different row for each event type. Under reaching the limit of events
wait event for a given event type, the next event will be lost.
Each CPU event has an associated priority, and the priorities are assigned
classified into priority groups. The following table summarizes the queuing depths, the
priority groups and priority levels for supported CPU events.
After the execution of an OB has started, OB processing cannot be interrupted
by the occurrence of another event from the same or lower priority group. The
Which event is queued for later processing will allow the current OB to complete.
However, an event from a higher priority group will interrupt the current OB, and the CPU
will then execute the OB of the higher priority event. After OB has priority
higher than complete, the CPU executes the OBs of other events queued in
this high-priority group, based on the priority that falls within that group. When there is no event
which is waiting (queuing) in this higher priority group, the CPU will revert to the priority group
lower priority and resume processing of the previously emptied OB, at which point
that OB's processing has been interrupted.
Interrupt event delay (time from CPU notification that an event has occurred)
occurs until the CPU begins execution of the first instruction in the event service OB
event) is approximately 210 microseconds, indicating that a program cycle OB is only
the event handler subroutine fires at the time of the interrupt event.
The condition that the maximum cycle time is exceeded occurs when the program cycle
does not complete within the specified maximum scan cycle time.
The requested OB cannot be initialized condition occurs when an OB is
requested by a cyclic interrupt or a time delay interrupt, but the OB is
That request has just been executed.
Queue overflow condition occurs when interrupts occur faster than
the speed at which they are processed. The number of waiting (queuing) events is limited to
using a different queue for each event type. If an event occurs
When the corresponding queue is full, a time error event is generated.
All timing error events will trigger the execution of OB 80, if any. If
OB 80 does not exist, the CPU will ignore this error. If the two dark cycle time conditions
exceeded occurs in the same program cycle without resetting the timer
then cycle, CPU will go into STOP mode, regardless of whether OB 80 exists or not.
OB 80 includes startup information that helps you determine which events and OBs have
generate error. You can program a script inside OB 80 to check initialization values
this action and to take the appropriate action. The following boot regions are supported
by OB 80:
All diagnostic error events will trigger the execution of OB 82 if it exists
in. If OB 82 does not exist, the CPU will then ignore the error. No OB 82 interrupt error
What diagnostics are present when you create a project. If desired, we add an OB 82 interrupt
Diagnostic error into the project by double clicking on “Add new block” below
“Program blocks”, then select “Organization block” and “Diagnostic error interrupt”.
OB 82 includes trigger information that helps us determine when an event is based
on the occurrence or removal of an error, and the device and channel that reported the error.
Bit 4 of IO_state indicates when the event was caused by occurrence or removal
of an error. Bit 4 will be 1 if an error is present (e.g. wire break) and 0 if error
not present.
The ladder input contains the hardware identifier (HW ID) of the device or units
function location returns an error. HW IDs are assigned automatically when components are
inserted into the device or network view and appears in the Constants tab of the recording cards
PLCs. A name is also automatically assigned to the HW ID. These entries
in the Constants tag of the PLC tags cannot be changed.
The channel number starts at 0 for the first input point (analog type
or digital) and starts at 64 for the first output point (analog or
numeric type). Various corrections are needed to distinguish the inputs from the
output in the event that the device contains both. If an error affects the complete equipment
tuning and functional units, i.e. without a source, the most significant bit of
channel number character to be set (channel number 32768).
The RE_TRIGR instruction (re-enable cycle time monitoring) allows us to
reset the timer then measure the cycle time. However, this command only works if it
is executed in an OB program cycle; RE_TRIGR command will be ignored if
is executed in OB 80. If the maximum scan cycle time is exceeded twice
in the same program cycle without RE_TRIGR instruction execution between both
twice, the CPU will then switch back to STOP immediately. The use of iterative executions
The repetition of the RE_TRIGR instruction can create an infinite loop or a very long scan cycle
long.
Usually, the scan cycle executes as fast as possible and the next scan
next starts as soon as the current scan cycle is complete. Depends on the program
user and communication tasks, the cycle time of each scan cycle can be
may vary between scan cycles. To eliminate this difference, the CPU supports a
Optional fixed minimum scan cycle time (also known as fixed scan cycle). When this optional function is activated and a scan cycle time is dark
fixed min is provided in milliseconds, CPU will maintain min cycle time
within ±1 ms for the completion of each CPU scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU completes the normal scan cycle in
time is less than the predetermined minimum scan cycle time, the CPU will use
additional scan cycle time to perform uptime diagnostics
and/or to process communication requests. In this way the CPU always takes a
fixed amount of time to complete a scan cycle.
In an event where the CPU is unable to complete the scan cycle within
Minimum cycle time is specified, the CPU will complete the scan cycle normally
normally (including communication processing) and does not generate any system response
as a result of exceeding the minimum scan time.
Load memory is a non-volatile storage area for human programs
usage, data and configuration. When a project is downloaded to the CPU, it first
stored in the load memory area. This area is placed in both a card
memory (if any) or in the CPU. This non-volatile memory is still maintained
when the power is lost. The memory card supports a larger storage space than the storage area
storage built into the CPU.
Working memory is a storage area for some elements of a human project
used while executing the user program. CPU copies a number
elements in the project from memory loaded into working memory. Variable Memory
This is lost when power is lost, and it is stored by the CPU when power is restored
restore.
Retained memory is a non-volatile storage area for a limited number of
limit working memory values. Retained memory area used for storage
values ​​of user-selected memory locations during
sourceless space. When the power is turned on again, the CPU has enough time to hold on
to maintain the values ​​of a limited number of special memory locations. The prices
This retained value is then restored when the power is turned on.
Bit memory (M): we can determine the exact width of memory for each tuple
Remember the bit in the PLC tag table or in the assignment list. Storage bit memory
always starts at MB0 and runs up successively to a specified number of
bytes. We determine this value from the PLC tag table or from the assignment list by
clicking on the “Retain” icon. Enter the number of bytes M to hold
start again at MB0.
Tags in a function block (FB): if a function block is created with box
“Symbolic access only” is selected, the editor interface for this FB then
will contain a column “Retain”. In this column, you can choose both “Retain” or
“Non-retain” separately for each record tag. An Instant DB has been created
output when this FB is placed in the editor will show this retain column, but
for display purposes only; We cannot change the save state from within the program
compose an instant DB interface for an FB that has been configured as
“Symbolic access only”.
If a FB was created with the “Symbolic access only” box unchecked,
This theme editor for FB will not include a “Retain” column. An Instant DB
was created when this FB was inserted in the editor the program will show
see an editable “Retain” column. In this case, choosing option
“Retain” for any tag will result in all tags selected.
Similarly, canceling the option selection for any tag will result in
All recording cards are deselected. For a configured FB that is not
“Symbolic access only”, we have tTo change the retention state from within the submission scope
instant DB editing, but all tags will be set to hold
together.
After creating FB, one cannot change the option for “Symbolic access
only”. This option can only be selected when the FB is created. To determine when
an existing FB configured for “Symbolic access only”, right click on FB
In the Project tree, select “Properties”, and then select “Attributes”.
A total of 2048 bytes of data can be held. To see how many bytes, word
PLC tab sheet or from the assignment list, click on the toolbar icon
"Retain". The second line will show the total remaining memory combined for M and DB, though
although this is where the retention ranges are defined for M.
The CPU supports a diagnostic buffer containing one entry per event
diagnose. Each entry includes the date and time the event occurred, a list of
event entry and an event description. The entries are displayed in order
time with the most recent event at the top. While the CPU maintains power, there is
The most recent 50 events are in this log. When the log is full, a new event will
replace the longest occurring event in the log. When the source is lost, 10 recent events
will be saved.
The CPU supports one hour of the day clock. A large capacitor provides power
amount required to keep the clock running for the duration that the CPU is powered off. Capacitors
This power is charged while the CPU is powered up. Arrive at least 2 hours after the CPU has
powered off, this large capacitor will be fully charged to keep the meter running for
Usually about 10 days.
Time of Day Clock is set according to the system time which is time
Coordinate Universal Time (UTC). There are commands to read system time
system (RD_SYS_T) or local time (RD_LOC_T). Local time is calculated in
how to use time zone and daylight saving correction that we set in
Device configuration section CPU Clock section.
We configure the hour of day clock for the CPU under the “Time of .” property
day". You can also activate daylight saving time and define the times
start and stop points for daylight saving time. To set up copper
hour of the day, you must be online and in the “Online &
Diagnostics” of the CPU. Use the “Set time of day” function.
The CPU initializes these bytes on the transition from STOP mode to mode
STARTUP. The bits of the timer memory change synchronously to the clock
CPU throughout STARTUP and RUN modes.
Each level allows known functions to be accessible without
a password. The default condition for the CPU is to have no restrictions and no
there is a password protection. To limit access to a CPU, we configure
Display the CPU properties and enter the password.
Entering a password over a network will not reduce the value of the password
password protection for the CPU. A password protected CPU allows only
unrestricted access to one user at a time. Secret protection
The password does not apply to the execution of the user program script including
communication functions. Entering the correct password will provide access to all
all functions.
PLC to PLC communication (using communication instruction set in code blocks)
is not restricted by the security level in the CPU. The HMI function is also not affected
limit.
STEP 7 Basic software facilitates symbolic programming. Pine
Usually, tags are created both in the PLC tag, in a data block, or in
interface at the top of an OB, FC or FB. These tags include name, data type,
data, corrections and legends. In addition, in a data block, an initial value has
can be established. You can use these tags when programming by entering
tag name in command parameter. Optionally, we can also enter the operand
independent (memory, device, size and offset) at the instruction parameter. Examples in
The following shows how to enter absolute operands. The % character is spelled
dynamically inserted before the absolute operand by the program editor. I can flip
change the view mode in the program editor to one of the following:
symbol (Symbolic), symbol and absolute (Symbolic and absolute) or absolute
(Absolute).
By adding “:P” to an address, we can immediately read the
to the digital or analog type of the CPU, SB, or SM. The difference between a retrieval
using I_:P instead of using I is that the data will come directly from the points
being accessed rather than from the input process image. Retrieve the referenced I_:P
to an “immediate read” access because the data is retrieved immediately from the source
rather than from a copy that was made the last time the input progress image
updated.
Since the physical input points receive their data directly from the field devices are connected to these points, writing to these points is prohibited.
That is to say, I_:P accesses are read-only, as opposed to I-accessibles
read or write.
I_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the possible inputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the inputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at I4.0, then
The input points can be accessed by addresses I4.0:P and I4.1:P or by IB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from I4.2:P through I4.7:P are not denied, but are not
are recognized, since these points are not used. Accesses to the IW4:P . address
and ID4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with the SB.
Since the physical output points directly control the connected field devices
to these points, reading from these points is prohibited. That means, the
Q_:P outputs are write-only, as opposed to Q accesses which can be read or written.
Q_:P accesses can also be restricted according to the size of the outputs
supported by a single CPU, SB or SM, rounded up to the nearest byte. Eg,
if the outputs of a 2 DI/2DQ SB are configured to start at Q4.0, then
Output points can be accessed by address Q4.0:P and Q4.1:P or by QB4:P.
Accesses to addresses from Q4.2:P to Q4.7:P are not denied, but
are not recognized, as these points are not used. Accesses to address
QW4:P and QD4:P are prohibited because they exceed the byte offset associated with SB.
Data types are used to specify the size of a data element
data as well as the manner in which the data is interpreted. Each command parameter supports at least
one data type, and some parameters also support multiple data types. We keep the pointer over
the parameter field of a command to see what data types are supported for a message
given number.
A formal parameter is an identifier on an instruction that marks the location of data
data used by that instruction (e.g. the IN1 input of an ADD instruction). Actual parameters
is actually a memory location or constant containing data used for an instruction (eg %MD400
“Number_of_Widgets”). The data type of the actual parameter is specified by the user
must match one of the official spec's supported data types
specified by the command.
When specifying an actual parameter, you must specify either a tag (symbol) or
an absolute memory address. Tags associated with a symbol name (tag name)
with a data type, a device, memory offset, and comment line, and can
created either in the PLC tag editor or in the Interface editor
for a block (OB, FC, FB or DB). If entering an absolute address without
tag related, one must use an appropriate size for the data type
supported, and a default tag will be created under the entry.
You can also enter constant values ​​for multiple input parameters. The following table
This describes the basic data types supported, including examples of fixed entry.
All types except String are available in the PLC tag editor
and in the block's Interface editor. The String type is only available in the editor
Draft the interface of the block. The following table defines the basic data types.
Real numbers (or floating point numbers) are displayed as numbers with precision
32-bit single-precision (Real) or 64-bit double-precision number (LReal) as described in
ANSI/IEEE 754-1985 standard. Single precision floating point numbers
accurate to up to 6 significant digits and double precision floating point numbers
is accurate to up to 15 significant digits. You can specify up to 6 significant digits
(Real type) or 15 significant digits (LReal) when entering a floating point constant
to maintain accuracy.
Calculations involving a long sequence of values ​​consisting of very large numbers or
very small can produce inaccurate results. This can occur if the numbers
less than 10 to the power of x, where x > 6 (Real type) or x > 15 (LReal type).
Example for Real: 100 000 000 + 1 = 100 000 000.
CPU supports String data type for storing a sequence of single byte characters
odd. The String data type contains a total character counter (the number of characters in the string) and
current character counter. String type provides up to 256 bytes for storing results
maximum total character count (1 byte), current character count result (1 byte) and max
254 characters, where each character is stored in 1 byte.
We can use orthogonal strings (constants) for command parameters of type
IN using single quotes. For example, a 3-character string 'ABC' might
is used as input to the IN parameter of the S_CONV instruction. You can also create string variables by selecting the data type “String” in the interface editor
blocks for OB, FC, FB and DB. You cannot create a string in the tag editor
take noteof PLCs. You can specify the maximum string size in bytes when declaring
string, for example, “MyString[10]” will specify a maximum size of 10 bytes for MyString.
If the square brackets are not included with the maximum size indicator, the value 254 will
Send.
The following example defines a string with a maximum character count of 10 and the value
current character count equals 3. This means that currently the string contains 3 1 byte characters,
but can be expanded to hold up to 10 1-byte characters.
but can be expanded to hold up to 10 1-byte characters.
Hogwarts before leaving in her 5th year, but she hated hospitals anyway, so she really didn’t mind.
Sometimes she worked for little or no money, when ill people came to her with empty pockets, but
she made enough to get by, and had even recently employed her friend Pen part time to help with
the bookkeeping.
By the time he reached the huge iron gates of Hogwarts, Harry found it hard to focus on them. They
seemed to loom over him, drifting dangerously. When they were closed behind him again, he
continued on across the grounds, stopping just outside the double oak doors to remove his cloak
and lean against the wall for support to gather his strength. Once the world stopped swirling
sickeningly, he pulled himself off the wall and walked into the entrance hall, heading up the marble
stairs.
As much as he yearned to see Ron and Hermione, he dreaded each and every step he took; the
guilt over what had happened, and the knowledge of what waited for him in the common room,
hung over him like a shadow in the empty hallways.
He could feel the Fat Lady watching him as he made his way slowly towards her, keeping his eyes
fixed on the ground at his feet. The long trip from Hogsmeade, had left him feeling feverish and
worn out, so he wiped the sweat from his brow on the back of a shaky sleeve, before saying the
password without looking at her.
The Fat Lady had grown rather fond of Neville over the past few years, having had frequent
incidents with him over forgotten passwords, and her silence as he stood there, waiting for her to
swing open, confirmed his worst fears. She blamed him, just like everyone else would. The painting
finally opened to reveal the entrance, and as Harry eased himself through it, he heard a muffled
sniff from her canvass.
His stomach dropped painfully.
He swayed as he walked into the common room. The low talk that had wafted through the room as
he entered, died to complete silence. He stood there for a moment, wishing the ground would
swallow him up, but their was no escaping what had happened.
His eyes fell on the only people in the room who were moving as he waited. Harry was swamped in
bushy brown hair as Hermione threw herself at him. He had thought he would want his friends to
rush to embrace him, but now that Hermione had him in a tight squeeze, he found he couldn’t hug
her back. Harry's arms hung loosely at his sides as she pulled away, her eyes swollen and watery.
‘Are you and Ron okay?’ he asked through shaky breaths as he fought to keep focused.
‘We’re fine, which is more than I can say for you.’ Ron was frowning deeply at Harry.
‘What about Lupin ... Tonks ... the others?’ he asked.
‘They all made it.’ Ron said solemnly.
‘Harry, where have you been? McGonagall told us what happened ... she said you were with
someone who was looking after you, but...’ she trailed off shaking her head, taking in his
appearance and wiping at her damp cheeks with her hand.
Aware that all eyes in the room were on them, he said ‘I’ll tell you about it -’ stopping abruptly as
he saw Ginny emerging from the girl’s dormitory. He felt the sweat beading on his face as he
dropped his gaze to the floor.
She walked silently to him and lifted a hand to his forehead. ‘Your ill, you shouldn't have come back
alone.’
‘We should take you to Madame Pomphrey!’ Hermione said quickly.
‘No!’ Harry said abruptly. He didn’t want to spend the night in the hospital ward, and he didn’t like
them fussing over him suddenly. It felt wrong that they should be so easy on him.
‘Upstairs’ Ginny quietly, and firmly took him by the hand, directing him up to the boy’s dorms.
Harry went; glad to be out of the watchful gaze of the other students. When they reached the
Gryffindor seventh year’s dorm, Ginny went over to the window and closed it against the strong
chill. When she turned, Harry was staring at Neville’s bed, transfixed by the loneliness of it.

- 138 -

Neville’s belongings had already been removed. Nothing remained. Except the knowledge that as far
as Harry was concerned, this was Neville’s space. As much as he didn’t want to think about it, he
couldn’t stop himself. Neville was one of the things about Hogwarts that had made it home. Neville
had always had faith in Harry. He had always trusted him. Guilty tears prickled at his eyes.
A soft touch on his arm made him turn. Ginny quietly spilled warm tears down her cheeks as she
looked at him, but now that he thought about his encounter with Julie, he could no longer look her
in the eye. She took a step closer and held him, but it did not comfort him, instead it doubled his
guilt. He knew he would have to tell her, he knew he wouldn’t be at peace until he did. And then it
would change everything. He knew. This would be the thing that would drive her to let go. But he
could not do it yet, not while her grief was so raw.
She pulled away; surprised that he did not return her embrace. A flicker of doubt registered in her
eyes, but she turned from him and pulled his bed sheets back.
‘Hermione’s gone to tell McGonagall you’re back.’ Ron said heavily as he entered the room.
‘Get in to bed.’ Ginny said as she stripped him of his jacket. ‘I’ll bring you up something to eat.’ Ron
cleared his throat as he hovered awkwardly by the cast iron fireplace.
‘What about class?’ Harry asked as he sunk between the sheets.
‘Saturday, mate. No class till Monday.’ Ron frowned in obvious concern.
‘Don’t you remember what day it is?’ Ginny started to wipe his forehead with a hand towel she had
dipped into the water jug, but Harry grabbed her arm.
‘Don’t’ he said without looking at her. ‘I can do it.’ Taking the cloth from her and pressing it to his
forehead, he laid back and put his head on the pillow, closing his eyes. He didn’t want her to touch
him. He didn’t want her pity. He didn't deserve it. He could sense she and Ron were exchanging
glances in the silence that followed, but it wasn’t until she left the room, that Ron spoke.
‘Where’ve you been?’
‘The Hog’s Head.’ Harry said, opening his eyes again to stare at the canopy above him.
‘Why there?’
‘It’s where I ended up,’ he placed the cloth on the bedside table 'after...' Ron didn’t wait for more.
‘So you were with Sir?’ he said sceptically.
‘Yeah, except he’s not just “Sir” anymore.’ He turned his head to look at Ron ‘His names Aberforth.
Aberforth Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore was his brother.’
Ron screwed his face up. ‘What ... him?’
‘I know now why he looked familiar to me the first time I saw him years ago at the pub. I’d already
seen a photo of him. Moody showed it to me at Sirius’s place.’ Harry stared at the ceiling again. ‘He
was a bit younger then, not so hairy as now, but it’s definitely him.’
‘How come he never said?’
‘No idea,’ Harry had wondered the same thing. There was silence for a moment.
‘You alright?’ Ron asked. Harry closed his eyes again. He didn’t want to go over everything that had
happened. He would tell Ron and Hermione soon, just not right now. ‘It’s just ... you’re ...’ Harry
looked at him as Ron lifted a finger hesitantly to his forehead, pointing at it ‘you’re playing with
your scar.’
Harry hadn’t even noticed that he was running his finger back and forth over it. He pulled his hand
away quickly. ‘It’s fine, it doesn’t hurt.’ He tried to sound normal, but didn't quite manage it. He had
told the truth, his scar wasn't hurting, but it itched with a strange feeling of pins and needles.
Hermione came in a short time later with a tray of porridge and toast, plonking it down on his bed
as he sat up.
‘We should have made you eat more.’ She said gravely, ‘I knew you were falling ill. I should’ve
made you eat.’ He didn’t feel a bit like eating right at that moment, but listening to Hermione made
him feel incredibly guilty, and he knew if he wanted to get well he was going to have eat more, so
he worked his way through the porridge while Ron and Hermione told him what happened to them
in Hogsmeade.

- 139 -

After the Death Eaters attacked, they ran for cover in a nearby alley, and found themselves being
pursued by two of the black-cloaked figures. They ran from street to street, dodging curses,
occasionally flinging one off of their own, but a terrible tiredness was creeping up on them.
Hermione said it was as if they’d drunk a sleeping potion, and then were stupidly trying to run off
the effects.
Eventually they were slouched against a vacant house, battling to keep their feet when the
persistent Death Eaters, who turned out to be Amycus and Avery, (names Harry recognized
immediately) closed in on them. Ron and Hermione tried to claw their way out of their stupor, but
their was no fighting it, and laughing at the state they were in, huddled in a doorway almost passed
out, Amycus and Avery raised their wands.
Ron said a curse that seemed to come from nowhere, knocked Avery off his feet, and when Amycus
turned in search of the caster, he was hit by a red flash and knocked unconscious too. That was the
last thing either of them remember. They woke up in the hospital wing the next day.
‘Must have been Lupin.’ Harry said. He had finished his porridge, and was lying back on the pillow
again. He closed his eyes as his own tiredness began to get the better of him.
‘Get some rest,’ Hermione said. ‘We’ll be back to check on you later.’
Harry only vaguely heard her as the warmth in his stomach from the much needed intake of food
spread pleasantly through him, and slowly lolled him to sleep.
‘Harry...’ a soft echoing voice called to him from afar. He was floating. Or was he drowning? He was
suspended in a sea of inky blackness, drifting with the current. Up ahead of him he could see a
light. He was slowly making his way towards the murky red glow.
‘Harry...’ there it was again. He pulled his body round to look over his shoulder. But there was
nothing but blackness behind him.
‘Harry!’ the voice echoed louder and he knew its sweet sound. He turned from the red glow, and
then someone was shaking him. Opening his eyes, he looked into Ginny’s worried face.
‘I’ve brought you something to eat.’ Her brow creased, as she stared at him. She was sitting on the
side of the bed in the low light of a single lamp.
‘What time is it?’ he asked, lifting himself up.
‘It’s six thirty, everyone’s in the Hall having dinner. How are you feeling?’
‘Tired.’ He said as he took the tray she handed him. He eyed the roast with a sigh. At least the plate
wasn’t piled high.
‘I didn’t put too much on,’ she said uncannily.
‘Thanks’ He cut the meat and placed it in his mouth.
Ginny stayed with him while he ate, keeping her conversation light as she talked mostly about
Hedwig. Harry asked after Socks, wondering why he hadn’t seen much of her around the castle
since his stay in the hospital wing, and Ginny told him she had disappeared almost three weeks ago.
When Harry looked startled she added that Socks had been the same ever since she’d known her,
which was almost a year. Far longer than Harry would have guessed since Ginny had never
mentioned her before.
The normalness of their conversation helped take Harry’s mind off things that would have affected
his appetite, so that when he finally put the tray down at his feet, there were only a few pieces of
carrot and a roast potato left.
‘Harry...’ Ginny sounded unsure of herself, heavy with emotion as he sat back on his pillows, still
finding it difficult to be under her gaze. ‘Neville came to me before he left for Hogsmeade. He said
something that I think you should hear...’
Harry looked Ginny directly in her slightly glazed for the first time since he returned, feeling a dull
ache in his chest.
"N-nothing."
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he
didn't like Harry at all.
"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.
"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so
nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want
to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about
the Dark Arts, Snape."
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to
his feet again. The hall fell silent.
"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to
all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember
that as well."
Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
twins.
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all
that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor
on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
die a very painful death."
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
"He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy.

102

"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he
usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the
forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he
might have told us prefects, at least."
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried
Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become
rather fixed.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose
high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"
And the school bellowed:
"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us things worth knowing,
Bring back what we've forgot,
just do your best, we'll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot.
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the
Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they

103

had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!
And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,
out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were
like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits
along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice
Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging
tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their
feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when
they came to a sudden halt.
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as
Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised
his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself"
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide
mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking
sticks.
"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.
"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked
Percy.
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on
Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as
he passed.
"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again.
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even
listen to us prefects. Here we are."

104

At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress.
"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait
swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled
through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the
Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were
obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five
four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had
already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their
pajamas and fell into bed.
" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."
Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he
fell asleep almost at once.
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange
dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to
him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was
his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened
painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with
it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh
became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,
sweating and shaking.
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he
didn't remember the dream at all.

CHAPTER EIGHT
THE POTIONS MASTER
There, look."
"Where?"

105
"Next to the tall kid with the red hair."
"Wearing the glasses?"
"Did you see his face?"
"Did you see his scar?"
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look
at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on
finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different
on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to
remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you
asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors
that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It
was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed
to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit
each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of
them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a
trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would
drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,
pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab
your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus
Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their
very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds
corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was
sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening
to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor
Quirrell, who was passing.

106

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature
with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the
corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of
line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds
later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than
anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly
as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest
ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes
themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,
than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the
movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little
witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of
all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only
one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old
indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got
up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on
and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the
Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had
to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their
first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he
gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a
talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class
will leave and not come back. You have been warned."
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they

107

weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match
and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,
only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor
McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and
gave Hermione a rare smile.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of
a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said
was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be
coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had
been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of
a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell
had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about
the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung
around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed
full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone
else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't
had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to
learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to
find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost
once.
"What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.
"Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of
Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see
if it's true."
"Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head
of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge
pile of homework the day before.
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but
it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a
hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,

108

circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters
and packages onto their laps.
Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to
nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the
owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered
down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto
Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy
scrawl:

Dear Harry,
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have
a cup of tea with me around three?
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
Hedwig.
Hagrid

Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the
back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because
the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to
him so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor
Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd
been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder
here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity."
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their

109

hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His
eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but
they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught
every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a
class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving
here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with
its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through
human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach
you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks
with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and
looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered
root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who
looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.
"I don't know, sit," said Harry.
Snape's lips curled into a sneer.
"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything."
He ignored Hermione's hand.
"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me
a bezoar?"
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without
her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were
shaking with laughter.
"I don't know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming,

110

eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those
cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did
Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs
and Fungi?
Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon
ceiling.
"I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why
don't you try her?"
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.
Snape, however, was not pleased.
"Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter,
asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach
of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and
wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of
aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,
Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your
cheek, Potter."
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a
simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing
almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just
telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned
slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the
dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a
twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,
burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was
standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the
potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils
sprang up all over his arms and legs.

111

"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one
wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before
taking the cauldron off the fire?"
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought
he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another
point you've lost for Gryffindor."
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked
him behind their cauldron.
"Doi* push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind
was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor
in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up,"
said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come
and meet Hagrid with you?"
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the
front door.
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and
several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang
-- back."
Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door
open.
"Hang on," he said. "Back, Fang."
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous
black boarhound.
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the
ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner

112
stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded
straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was
clearly not as fierce as he looked.
"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a
large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
"Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent
half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their
teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's
knee and drooled all over his robes.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang
sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me
everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not
to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.
"But he seemed to really hate me."
"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?"
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes
when he said that.
"How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot --
great with animals."
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron
told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a
piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a
cutting from the Daily Prophet:
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST

113

Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,
widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault
that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if
you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this
afternoon.
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to
rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.
"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
It might've been happening while we were there!"
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes
this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the
story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and
thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little
package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets
weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry
thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much
to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package
just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about
Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?

CHAPTER NINE
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,
but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year
Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to
put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a
notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and
Slytherin would be learning together.

114

"Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool
of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy."
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said Ron
reasonably. "Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he
is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk."
Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about
first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,
boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping
Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus
Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen
about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron
had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their
dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game
with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron
prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the
players move.
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had
good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of
accidents even with both feet on the ground.
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This
was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she
hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with
flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through
the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for
anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but
everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted
by the arrival of the mail.
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that
Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was
always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened
gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He

115

opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large
marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things -- this
tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it
tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,
"You've forgotten something..."
Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy,
who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his
hand.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason
to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble
quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
"What's going on?"
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.
"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind
him.
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors
hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying
lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their
feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn
on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees
were swaying darkly in the distance.
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying
in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley
complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to
vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and
yellow eyes like a hawk.
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a

116

broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck
out at odd angles.
"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the
front, "and say 'Up!"'
"UPF everyone shouted.
Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few
that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and
Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's
voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the
ground.
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding
off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it
wrong for years.
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said
Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come
straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three
-- two --"
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the
ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's
lips.
"Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a
cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his
scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,
slip sideways off the broom and --
WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass
in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and
started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.
"Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right,

117

up you get.".
She turned to the rest of the class.
"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You
leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before
you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with
Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
"Did you see his face, the great lump?"
The other Slytherins joined in.
"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil.
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
Slytherin girl. "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,
Parvati."
"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the
grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
"Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking
to watch.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about --
up a tree?"
"Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick
and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level
with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it,
Potter!"
Harry grabbed his broom.

118

"No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move --
you'll get us all into trouble."
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom
and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed
through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being
taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up
a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls
back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked
stunned.
"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!" "Oh,
yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom
tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy
only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and
held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
"Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball
high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and
then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down
-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball
-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people
watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he
caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled
gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
"HARRY POTTER!"
His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was
running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.
"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"

119

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses
flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"
"It wasn't his fault, Professor --"
"Be quiet, Miss Patil
"But Malfoy --"
"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now."
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he
left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward
the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to
say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong
with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even
looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't
even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What
would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor
McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched
along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was
taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to
stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His
stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming
wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door
and poked her head inside.
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on
him?
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out
of Flitwicles class looking confused.
"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up
the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.

120

"In here."
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except
for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
"Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which
clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed
the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.
"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker."
Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
"Are you serious, Professor?"
"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural.
I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a
broomstick, Potter?"
Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he
didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming
back to his legs.
"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor
McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley
couldn't have done it."
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.
"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained.
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around
Harry and staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a
decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,
I'd say."
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the
first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape
in the face for weeks...."

121

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind
about punishing you."
Then she suddenly smiled.
"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent
Quidditch player himself."
"You're joking."
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened
when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of
steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about
it.
"Seeker?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest
house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his
mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the
afternoon. "Wood told me."
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.
"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood
wants to keep it a secret."
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and
hurried over.
"Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the
team too -- Beaters."
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"
said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is
going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping
when he told us."
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret
passageway out of the school."
"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found
in our first week. See you."

122

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome
turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the
Muggles?"
"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got
your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course
nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was
full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their
knuckles and scowl.
"I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want.
Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard
of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's
yours?"
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
"Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy
room; that's always unlocked."
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a
wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?"
"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually,
getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's
face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know,
with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send
sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real
damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway."
"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?"
"Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. "Excuse me."
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron.

123
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --"
"Bet you could," Ron muttered.
"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the
points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be.
It's really very selfish of you."
"And it's really none of your business," said Harry.
"Good-bye," said Ron.
All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,
Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus
falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had
spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you,
you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or
Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another
school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming
up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy
face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.
"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across
the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor
common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning
all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached
the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I
can't believe you're going to do this, Harry."
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe
and a frown.
"You!" said Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!"
"I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a
prefect, he'd put a stop to this."
Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.

124

"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady
and climbed through the hole.
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through
the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I
don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the
points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
Spells."
"Go away." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said
when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --"
But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the
portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an
empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione
was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.
"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be
late."
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up
with them.
"I'm coming with you," she said.
"You are not."
"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying
to stop you, and you can back me up."
"You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly.
"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something."
It was a sort of snuffling.
"Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.

125

It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,
fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't
remember the new password to get in to bed."
"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't
help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere."
"How's your arm?" said Harry.
"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a
minute."
"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you
later --"
"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to
stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and
Neville.
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that
Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the
Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned
them all forward.
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.
Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor
and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered
where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues
winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took
out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes
crept by.

126

"He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered.
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised
his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly
at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried
silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had
barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy
room.
"They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding."
"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to
creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch
getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke
into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of
them toppled right into a suit of armor.
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
"RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not
looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,
without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled
along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was
miles from the trophy room.
"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall
and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and
spluttering.
I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,
"I -- told -- you."
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as
possible."
"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't
you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to

127

be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off."
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her
that.
"Let's go."
It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen
paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
classroom in front of them.
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
Peeves cackled.
"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,
naughty, you'll get caughty."
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
"Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his
eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know."
"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a
big mistake.
"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED
DOWN THE
CHARMS CORRIDOR"
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.
"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're
done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as
fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.
"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the
lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"
The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut

128

it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me."
"Say 'please."'
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his
annoying singsong voice.
"All right -please."
"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch cursing in rage.
"He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay
-- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?"
Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he
was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of
everything that had happened so far.
They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that
filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.
Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching
and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging
in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry
knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their
sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting
over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take
Filch.

129

They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they
almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look
for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they
hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible
between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their
bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the
portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and
collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked
as if he'd never speak again.
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up
in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one
does."
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You
don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see
what it was standing on.
"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too
busy with its heads."
"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously
guarding something."
She stood up, glaring at them.
I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --
or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
"No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along,
wouldn't you.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed

130

back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to
hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package
from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.

CHAPTER TEN
HALLOWEEN
Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the
three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite
keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the
package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and
they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy
protection. "It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron.
"Or both," said Harry.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it
was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what
it was without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never
going near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a
bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really
wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great
delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention
was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech
owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in
this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped
it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had
hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top
of the parcel.

131

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:

DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody
knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood
will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your
first training session.
Professor McGonagall
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to
read.
"A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched
one."
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private
before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they
found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the
package from Harry and felt it.
"That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture
of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time,
Potter, first years aren't allowed them."
Ron couldn't resist it.
"It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron
grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same
league as the Nimbus."
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the
handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to
save up twig by twig."
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.
"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.

132

"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.
"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,
Potter. And what model is it?"
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the
look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here
that I've got it," he added.
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's
obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they
reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's
Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."
"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an
angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,
looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.
"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry.
"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good."
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It
kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying
under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be
learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without
noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it
looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long
tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold
near the top.
As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the
dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium
before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that
the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end

133

of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They
reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle
children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick
and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out
of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two
Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
"Hey, Potter, come down!'
Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall
meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules
this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even
if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.
Three of them are called Chasers."
"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball
about the size of a soccer ball.
"This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the
Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to
score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the
hoops. Follow me?"
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,"
Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with
six hoops, isn't it?"
"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind," said Harry
quickly.
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm
Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other
team from scoring."

134

"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember
it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are
they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.
"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this."
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are
the Bludgers."
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than
the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to
escape the straps holding them inside the box.
"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the
Bludgers.
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at
Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking
his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around
their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to
pin it to the ground.
"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate
and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to
knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each
team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their
side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So
-- think you've got all that?"
"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the
goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry
reeled off.
"Very good," said Wood.
"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he
sounded offhand.
"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse
than that. Now, the last member of the team is the

135

Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the
Bludgers unless they crack my head open."
"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I
mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves."
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size
of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver
wings.
"This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important
ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and
difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave
in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it
before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the
Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they
nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages
-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on
substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any
questions?"
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was
doing it that was going to be the problem.
"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting
it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try
you out with a few of these."
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf
balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.
Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an
hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.
"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily
as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you
turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for
England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."

136

Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice
three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly
believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two
months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His
lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
mastered the basics.
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin
wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced
in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,
something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make
Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the
class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which
was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,
however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell
whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to
either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as
usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic
words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,
who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a
buffalo on his chest."
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the
feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the
desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and
set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.
"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium
Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."

"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,
"Wingardium Leviosa!"

137

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their
heads.
"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here,
Miss Granger's done it!"
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder no
one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the
crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.
Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she
was in tears.
"I think she heard you."
"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed
she's got no friends."
Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all
afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,
Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that
Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had
entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out
of their minds.
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the
candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the
golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell
came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped
against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you
ought to know."
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from
the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.

138

"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories
immediately!"
Percy was in his element.
"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if
you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years
coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!"
"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.
"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe
Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry
suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.
"I've just thought -- Hermione."
"What about her?"
"She doesn't know about the troll."
Ron bit his lip.
"Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped
down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'
bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick
footsteps behind them.
"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the
corridor and disappeared from view.
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons
with the rest of the teachers?"
"Search me."

139

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's
fading footsteps.
"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his
hand.
"Can you smell something?"
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old
socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of
gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,
something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and
watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite
gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head
perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks
with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was
holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its
arms were so long.
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its
long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in."
"Good idea," said Ron nervously.
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't
about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the
key, slam the door, and lock it.
'Yes!"
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but
as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts
stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber
they'd just chained up.
"Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.

140
"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped.
"Hermione!" they said together.
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?
Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,
fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if
she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the
sinks off the walls as it went.
"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking
stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw
Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it
went.
"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he
threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe
hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning
its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward
the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,
her mouth open with terror.
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It
roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to
escape.
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He
took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the
troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there,
but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its
nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it
had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry
clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him

141
off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand --
not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell
that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into
the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto
its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its
face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
"Is it -- dead?"
I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out."
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered
in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
"Urgh -- troll boogers."
He wiped it on the troll's trousers.
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.
They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,
someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A
moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,
closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell
took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly
down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and
Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's
mind.
"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with
cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with
his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in

142

your dormitory?"
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He
wished Ron would put his wand down.
Then a small voice came out of the shadows.
"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."
"Miss Granger!"
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it
on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a
teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand
up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have
time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they
arrived."
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.
"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the
three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last
person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending
she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started
handing out sweets.
"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said
Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt
at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing
the feast in their houses."
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have

143

taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five
points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had
climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the
troll, quite apart from anything else.
"We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled.
"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."
"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind
you, we did save her."
"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with
her," Harry reminded him.
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
"Pig snout," they said and entered.
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that
had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting
for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking
at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are
some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and
knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
QUIDDITCH
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains
around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every
morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the
upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled
up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous
beaverskin boots.
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in

144

his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If
Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house
championship.
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as
their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news
that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know
which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people
telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't
know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what
with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She
had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a
very interesting read.
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup
match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest
players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to
them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had
been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry
and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer
for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured
them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape
crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;
they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about
their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen
the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off
anyway.
"What's that you've got there, Potter?"
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape.
"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor."

145

"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped
away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?"
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly.
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and
Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will
you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right
answers anyway.
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take
his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of
Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if
he could have it.
"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that
Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.
He knocked again. Nothing.
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed
the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above
his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing
Snape bandages.
"Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your
eyes on all three heads at once?"
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --
"POTTER!"
Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to
hide his leg. Harry gulped.
"I just wondered if I could have my book back."
"GET OUT! OUT!"

146

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He
sprinted back upstairs.
"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. "What's the matter?"
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.
"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get
past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when
we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my
broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!"
Hermione's eyes were wide.
"No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he
wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"
snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But
what's he after? What's that dog guarding?"
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville
was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind
-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a
few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his
leg wasn't easy to forget.
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of
the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of
everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
"You've got to eat some breakfast."
"I don't want anything."
"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione.
"I'm not hungry."
Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are
always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."

147

"Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his
sausages.
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around
the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be
raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going
on sometimes.
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in
the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on
one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and
Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion
underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that
the paint flashed different colors.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were
changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing
in green).
Wood cleared his throat for silence.
"Okay, men," he said.
"And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
"And women," Wood agreed. "This is it."
"The big one," said Fred Weasley.
"The one we've all been waiting for," said George.
"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the
team last year."
"Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had
in years. We're going to win. I know it."
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else."
"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you."
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his

148

knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting
for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all
gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the
corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing
Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
"Mount your brooms, please."
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the
Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what
an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --"
"JORDAN!"
"Sorry, Professor."
The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the
match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet,
a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to
Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin
Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying
like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent
move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle --
that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint,
off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of
the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a
second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell
which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in
possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's
really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead

149

-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses --
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the
Slytherins.
"Budge up there, move along."
"Hagrid!"
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join
them.
"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of
binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the
crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?"
"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet."
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his
binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for
some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had
said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to
let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.
Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection
from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to
come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger
furiously toward Marcus Flint.
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks
two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --
wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too

150

busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his
left ear.
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the
streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck
and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have
forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to
watch.
Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings
fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint
had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry
holding on for dear life.
"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors.
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the
goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the
Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red
card!"
"What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron.
"Red card!" said Dean furiously. "In soccer you get shown the red card
and you're out of the game!"
"But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him.
Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.
"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the
air."
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.

151
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul
'Jordan, I'm warning you --"
"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which
could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by
Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor
still in possession."
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously
past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening
lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped
the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt
anything like that.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him
off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their
riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts
-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he
realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't
turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the
air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that
almost unseated him.
Lee was still commentating.
"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --
passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose
-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's
broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away
from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through
his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of
his broom... but he can't have...."
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His
broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to
hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild
jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on
with only one hand.

152

"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered.
"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere
with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to
a Nimbus Two Thousand."
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of
looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced.
"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look."
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands
opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
under his breath.
"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione.
"What should we do?"
"Leave it to me."
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned
the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was
almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on
its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull
Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time
they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower
and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.
Marcus
Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately.
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and
was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say
sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a
few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the
hem of Snape's robes.

153

It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him
into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --
Snape would never know what had happened.
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on
to his broom.
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into
Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his
hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field
on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the
game ended in complete confusion.
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling
twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken
any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry
heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back
in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was
cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next
to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell
him. Harry decided on the truth.
"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying
to steal whatever it's guarding."
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
"How do you know about Fluffy?" he said.

154

"Fluffy?"
"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub
las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
"Yes?" said Harry eagerly.
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret,
that is."
"But Snape's trying to steal it."
"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do
nothin' of the sort."
"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.
The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about
Snape.
I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!
You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw
him!"
"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why
Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!
Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don'
concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what
it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel
--"
"Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,
is there?"
Hagrid looked furious with himself.

CHAPTER TWELVE
THE MIRROR OF ERISED
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find

155

itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that
they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The
few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to
deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could
fly off again.
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common
room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had
become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.
Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where
their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as
possible to their hot cauldrons.
"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all
those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're
not wanted at home."
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch
match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get
everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing
Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny,
because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay
on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back
to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of
students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up
at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be
the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying,
too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit
Charlie.
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large
fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at
the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the
branches.

156

"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron."
"Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from
behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping
to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut
of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used
to."
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
"WEASLEY!"
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.
"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family."
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said
Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it
isn't more. Move along, all of you."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering
needles everywhere and smirking.
"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of
these days, I'll get him --"
"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape."
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what,
come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat."
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great
Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
the Christmas decorations.
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all
around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood
around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with
hundreds of candles.

157

"How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked.
"Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got
half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor
Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was
trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
"The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before
the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"
"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you
mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is."
"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop
it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione.
"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We
must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him
anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere."
"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.
"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left
Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid
had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape
was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to
begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a
book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable
Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern
Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And
then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to
search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them
off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted
Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in

158

there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never
get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never
taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced
Defense Against the Dark Arts.
"What are you looking for, boy?"
"Nothing," said Harry.
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!"
Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left
the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not
ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be
able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were
up to.
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found
anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two
weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it
wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a
nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.
They went off to lunch.
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And
send me an owl if you find anything."
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron.
"It'd be safe to ask them."
"Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione.
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time
to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the
common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the
good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they
could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows
-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk

159

about even if they wouldn't work.
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like
Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot
like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.
Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in
his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen
weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble
getting them to do what he wanted.
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't
trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept
shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't
send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose
him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next
day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and
pulled on his bathrobe.
"You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"
"What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which
was a lot bigger than Harry's.
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and
scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut
wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --
it sounded a bit like an owl.
A second, very small parcel contained a note.
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
"That's friendly," said Harry.
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
"Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?"

160

"You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. "Hagrid
and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?"
"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and
pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect
any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley
sweater."
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in
emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
"Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and
mine's always maroon."
"That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was
very tasty.
His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs
from Hermione.
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very
light. He unwrapped it.
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it
lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of
Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it
is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."
"What is it?"
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to
the touch, like water woven into material.
"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm
sure it is -- try it on."
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
"It is! Look down!"
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the

161

mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak
over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
"There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!"
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,
loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your
father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was
returned to you. Use it well.
A Very Merry Christmas to you.

There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the
cloak.
"I'd give anything for one of these," he said. "Anything. What's the
matter?"
"Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had
it really once belonged to his father?
Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung
open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak
quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else
yet.
"Merry Christmas!"
"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!"
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on
it, the other a G.
"Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's
sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it
on, they're lovely and warm."
"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.

162

"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she
thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're
called Gred and Forge."
"What's all th is noise.
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He
had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,
carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which
Fred seized.
"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even
Harry got one."
"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater
over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said
George. "Christmas is a time for family."
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by
his sweater.
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of
chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy
and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet
along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the
feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little
plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard
cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like
a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the
inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at
the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a
flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick
had just read him.
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his
teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid
getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,
finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's

163

amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of
things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous
balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball
fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they
returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in
his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he
wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,
everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and
watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
they'd stolen his prefect badge.
It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been
nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed
was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had
sent it.
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,
fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his
four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the
cloak out from under it.
His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow
over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note
had said.
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak
around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and
shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
Use it well.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him
in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the
dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch
would never know.

164

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back
-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he
wanted to use it alone.
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,
and climbed through the portrait hole.
"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked
quickly down the corridor.
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then
it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to
read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he
walked.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his
way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along
in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the
sight gave him the creeps.
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping
carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the
library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.
They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled
words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The
hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,
maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,
as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,
he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large
black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with
difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,
let it fall open.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was
screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one
high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over
his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming

165

down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the
shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild
eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's
outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks
still ringing in his ears.
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been
so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where
he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he
was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he
must be five floors above there.
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was
wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted
Section."
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must
know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and
to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well,
they can't be far, we'll catch them."
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner
ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor
and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak
didn't stop him from being solid.
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It
was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying
not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room
without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry
leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps
dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before
he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs
were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper
basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that
didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone
had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved
around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic

166

fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved
nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but
a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to
the mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,
reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his
shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,
too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's
trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt
the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their
reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the
others existed only in the mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her
eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the
glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that
she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,
black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore
glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as
Harry's did.
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching
that of his reflection.
"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the
faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green
eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as
though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,
for the first time in his life.

167

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at
them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping
to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache
inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade
and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He
tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back,"
and hurried from the room.
"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly.
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.
"I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly.
"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to
show me your other brothers and everyone."
"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house
this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not
finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you
eating anything?"
Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them
again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very
important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?
What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
"Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd."
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror
room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much
more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the
library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back."
"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere."
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,
but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead

168
with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
"It's here -- just here -- yes!"
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his
shoulders and ran to the mirror.
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
"See?" Harry whispered.
"I can't see anything."
"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...."
"I can only see you."
"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am."
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't
see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
"Look at me!" he said.
"Can you see all your family standing around you?"
"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head
boy!"
"What?"
"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the
house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at
Harry.
"Do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --"

169

"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I
want to see my parents."
"Don't push me --"
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
"Quick!"
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris
came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the
same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she
turned and left.
"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.
Come on."
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.
"Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron.
"No."
"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"
"No... you go..."
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back
tonight."
"Why not?"
"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had
too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into
you? What if you knock something over?"
"You sound like Hermione."

170

"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in
front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was
walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he
didn't meet anyone.
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of
his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in
front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
night with his family. Nothing at all.
Except --
"So -- back again, Harry?"
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind
him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to
get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.
" -- I didn't see you, sir."
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of
the Mirror of Erised."
"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."
"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"
"It -- well -- it shows me my family --"
"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy."
"How did you know --?"

171

"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently.
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?"
Harry shook his head.
"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it
and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?"
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want...
whatever we want..."
"Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have
never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,
who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing
alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by
what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is
real or even possible.
"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will
now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,
remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and
get off to bed?"
Harry stood up.
"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?"
"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one
more thing, however."
"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"
"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
Harry stared.
"One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on
giving me books."

172

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
NICOLAS FLAMEL
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the
invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry
wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he
couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed
about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high
voice cackled with laughter.
"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said
Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different
view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being
out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had
caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who
Nicolas Flamel was.
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary
book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.
Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten
minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other
two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that
had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys
complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's
side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would
overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven
years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer
nightmares when he was tired out after training.
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave
the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the

173

Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off
their brooms.
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of
thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll
be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's
he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we
might overtake Slytherin."
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for
not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the
end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common
room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only
thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very
good for her.
"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry's face. "What's the
matter with you? You look terrible."
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other
two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
"Don't play," said Hermione at once.
"Say you're ill," said Ron.
"Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested.
"Really break your leg," said Ron.
"I can't," said Harry. "There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out,

174

Gryffindor can't play at all."
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed
to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs
had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the
Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to
Gryffindor tower.
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed
the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,
trembling. "What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit
with Harry and Ron.
"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said
he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"
Neville shook his head.
"I don't want more trouble," he mumbled.
"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He's used to
walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of
him and make it easier."
"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,
Malfoy's already done that," Neville choked out.
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,
the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He
gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.
"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you
for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.
"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you
collect them, don't you?"
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.

175

"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-"
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron
and Hermione.
"I've found him!" he whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read
the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen
to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark
wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
Flamel'!"
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd
gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.
"Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'
dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks
before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this
out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,
muttering to herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
"I knew it! I knew it!"
"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
"Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker
of the Sorcerer's Stone!"
This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.
"The what?" said Harry and Ron.
"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there."
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient
study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a

176

legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which
will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries,
but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel,
the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six
hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon
with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
"See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must be
guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it
safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it,
that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Harry. "No
wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it."
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent
Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly recent if he's
six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down
different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still
discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It
wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry
remembered about Snape and the coming match.
"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the
Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show
them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione.
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,
whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm,
either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was
wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed
to, with such a biased referee?
Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to
keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered
whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions

177

lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so
horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the
Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had
the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the
next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever
see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry
hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch
robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to
Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or
why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker
Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were
ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron
slipped his wand up his sleeve.
"I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag."
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early
capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff too much."
"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the
door. "Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"
Harry's heart did a somersault.
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.
There was no mistaking that silver beard.
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was
simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was
watching.
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched
onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.

178

"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look -they're
off Ouch!"
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone
want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because
George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her
fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said
Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another
penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See,
there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've
got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no
brains."
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not
daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and
that's saying something."
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety
about Harry.
"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word
"Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --"
"What? Where?"

Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and
cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her
mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the
ground!" said Malfoy.
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of
him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over
the back of his seat to help.
"Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as
Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron
rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the
whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see
something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next
second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the
Snitch clasped in his hand.
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember
the Snitch being caught so quickly.
"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won!
Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on
her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe
it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five
minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his
shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.
"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.
"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping
busy... excellent..."
Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two
Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling

180

happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could
say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never
smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour
in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him
onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked
up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.
Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....
And speaking of Snape...
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly
not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the
forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He
recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest
while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding
silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He
followed.
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in
circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he
heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering
beech tree.
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his
broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy
clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.
Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.
"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,
Severus..."
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy.
"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after
all."
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted
him.

"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
"B-b-but Severus, I --"
"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step
toward him.
"I-I don't know what you
"You know perfectly well what I mean."
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied
himself in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
I'm waiting."
"B-but I d-d-don't --"
"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when
you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties
lie."
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was
almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as
though he was petrified.
"Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked.
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. "And
I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle
single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all
right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the
common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and
stuff from the kitchens."
"Never mind that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty
room, you wait 'til you hear this...."
He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them,
then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to
force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past

182

Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon
there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of
enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts
spell that Snape needs to break through --"
"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?" said Hermione in alarm.
"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.
